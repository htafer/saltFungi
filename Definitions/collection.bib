abstract = {Exophiala dermatitidis, one of the saprophytic dematiaceous fungi, is a rare cause of human infection that, when invasive, is nearly always fatal. Besides the more common subcutaneous infection usually caused by traumatic inoculation, infection can also spread hematogenously, in which case the organism has a distinct neurotropism. A patient with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease of childhood who was found to have a progressive pulmonary and central nervous system infection with E. dermatitidis responded to an aggressive, multifaceted therapeutic approach. Scanning electron microscopy of the cultured conidiogenous cells confirmed that the manner of conidiogenesis is typical of the genus Exophiala. We report the first successful treatment of an infection involving the lungs and central nervous system by a combination of surgical resection of the pulmonary source and medical therapy with amphotericin B, flucytosine or ketoconazole, and transfused white cells, followed by a prolonged course of fluconazole.},

@misc{Urban2006,
abstract = {The rhomboid gene was discovered in Drosophila, where it encodes a seven transmembrane protein that is the signal-generating component of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling during development. Although metazoan developmental regulators are rarely conserved outside the animal kingdom, rhomboid proteins are conserved in all kingdoms of life, but the significance of this remains unclear. Recent biochemical reconstitution and high-resolution crystal structures have provided proof that rhomboid proteins function as novel intramembrane proteases, with a serine protease-like catalytic apparatus embedded within the membrane bilayer, buried in a hydrophilic cavity formed by a protein ring. A thorough consideration of all known examples of rhomboid function suggests that, despite biochemical similarity in mechanism and specificity, rhomboid proteins function in diverse processes including quorum sensing in bacteria, mitochondrial membrane fusion, apoptosis, and stem cell differentiation in eukaryotes; rhomboid proteins are also now starting to be linked to human disease, including early-onset blindness, diabetes, and parasitic diseases. Regulating cell signaling is at the heart of rhomboid protein function in many, but not all, of these processes. Further study of these novel enzymes promises to reveal the evolutionary path of rhomboid protein function, which could provide insights into the forces that drive the molecular evolution of regulatory mechanisms.},

@article{Zheng2004,
abstract = {The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans switches from yeast to hyphal growth when exposed to serum or phagocytosed. However, the importance of this morphological switch for virulence remains highly controversial due to the lack of a mutant that affects hyphal morphogenesis only. Although many genes specifically expressed in hyphal cells have been identified and shown to encode virulence factors, none is required for hyphal morphogenesis. Here we report the first hypha-specific gene identified, HGC1, which is essential for hyphal morphogenesis. Deletion of HGC1 abolished hyphal growth in all laboratory conditions tested and in the kidneys of systemically infected mice with markedly reduced virulence. HGC1 expression is co-regulated with other virulence genes such as HWP1 by the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway and transcriptional repressor Tup1/Nrg1. Hgc1 is a G1 cyclin-related protein and co-precipitated with the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) CaCdc28. It has recently emerged that cyclin/Cdk complexes promote other forms of polarized cell growth such as tumor cell migration and neurite outgrowth. C. albicans seems to have adapted a conserved strategy to control specifically hyphal morphogenesis.},

@article{Martinez-Lopez2006,
abstract = {Candida albicans ECM33 encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell wall protein that is important for cell wall integrity. It is also critical for normal virulence in the mouse model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. To identify potential mechanisms through which Ecm33p contributes to virulence, we investigated the interactions of C. albicans ecm33Delta mutants with endothelial cells and the FaDu oral epithelial cell line in vitro. The growth rate of blastospores of strains containing either one or no intact copies of ECM33 was 50{\%} slower than that of strains containing two intact copies of ECM33. However, all strains germinated at the same rate, forming similar-length hyphae on endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells. Strains containing either one or no intact copies of ECM33 had modestly reduced adherence to both types of host cells, and a markedly reduced capacity to invade and damage these cells. Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing C. albicans ECM33 did not adhere to or invade epithelial cells, suggesting that Ecm33p by itself does not act as an adhesin or invasin. Examination of ecm33Delta mutants by transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cell wall of these strains had an abnormally electron-dense outer mannoprotein layer, which may represent a compensatory response to reduced cell wall integrity. The hyphae of these mutants also had aberrant surface localization of the adhesin Als1p. Collectively, these results suggest that Ecm33p is required for normal cell wall architecture as well as normal function and expression of cell surface proteins in C. albicans.},

@article{Lafontaine,
abstract = {Bacteria and eukaryotes adopt very different strategies to modify their rRNAs. Most sites of eukaryotic rRNA modification are selected by guide small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), while bacteria rely on numerous site-specific modification enzymes. This raises a ‘chicken and egg' dilemma: how could a system of modification that requires a large number of snoRNA cofactors have developed? Did it arise in a de novo fashion, or evolve from a pre-existing protein-based system? The rRNA sequences are well conserved in evolution, but the pattern of modification is only moderately conserved, and many more sites are modified in eukaryotes than in bacteria; why is this so? We propose a model for the origins of the modification-guide snoRNAs that attempts to answer these questions.},

abstract = {Dozens of box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have recently been found in eukaryotes (vertebrates, yeast), ancient eukaryotes (trypanosomes) and archae, that specifically target ribosomal RNA sites for 2′-O-ribose methylation. Although early biochemical data revealed that plant rRNAs are among the most highly ribomethylated in eukaryotes, only a handful of methylation guide snoRNAs have been characterized in this kingdom. We report 66 novel box C/D snoRNAs identified by computational screening of Arabidopsis genomic sequences that are expressed in vivo from either single genes, 17 different clusters or three introns. At the structural level, many box C/D snoRNAs have dual antisense elements often matching rRNA regions close to each other on the rRNA secondary structure, which is reminiscent of their archaeal counterparts. Remarkable specimens are found that display two antisense elements having the potential to form an extended snoRNA-rRNA duplex of 23 to 30 nt, in line with the hypothetical function of box C/D snoRNAs in pre-rRNA folding or chaperoning. In contrast to other species, many Arabidopsis snoRNAs are found in multiple isoforms mainly resulting from two different mechanisms: large chromosomal duplications and small tandem duplications producing polycistronic genes. The discovery of numerous different snoRNAs, some of them arising from common ancestors, provide new insights to understand snoRNAs evolution and the birth of new rRNA methylation sites in plants and other organisms.},

abstract = {HBII-52 is a human brain-specific C/D box snoRNA that potentially regulates the editing and/or alternative splicing of the serotonin receptor. Forty-two nearly identical copies of the HBII-52 gene are located immediately downstream of the SNRPN protein-coding gene in an imprinted locus associated with Prader–Willi syndrome. Other eutherian mammals, with genomic assemblies covering the corresponding locus, also have multiple orthologous copies of HBII-52. The SNRPB gene, which is known to have given rise to SNRPN through gene duplication, expresses a C/D box snoRNA, SNORD119, from its fifth intron. Here we show that, despite the fact that they lie in different positions relative to the orthologous SNRPB/SNRPN coding sequences, there are significant sequence similarities between SNORD119 and HBII-52, including the antisense element and the stem-forming regions. By analysing these snoRNAs in marsupial and eutherian mammal genomes, we reconstruct the likely evolutionary history of the HBII-52 cluster and SNORD119 and suggest that they have evolved from a common ancestor.},

Since their discovery about 30 years ago, many gaps in our understanding of the biology and function of SINEs have been filled. This review summarizes the past and recent advances in the studies of SINEs. The structure and origin of SINEs as well as the processes involved in their amplification, transcription, RNA processing, reverse transcription, and integration of a SINE copy into the genome are considered. Then we focus on the significance of SINEs for the host genomes. While these genomic parasites can be deleterious to the cell, the long-term being in the genome has made SINEs a valuable source of genetic variation providing regulatory elements for gene expression, alternative splice sites, polyadenylation signals, and even functional RNA genes.},

abstract = {The human genome is scattered with repetitive sequences, and the ENCODE project revealed that 60-70{\%} of the genomic DNA is transcribed into RNA. As a consequence, the human transcriptome contains a large portion of repeat-derived RNAs (repRNAs). Here, we present a hypothesis for the evolution of novel functional repeat-derived RNAs from non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) by retrotransposition. Upon amplification, the ncRNAs can diversify in sequence and subsequently evolve new activities, which can result in novel functions. Non-coding transcripts derived from highly repetitive regions can therefore serve as a reservoir for the evolution of novel functional RNAs. We base our hypothetical model on observations reported for short interspersed nuclear elements derived from 7SL RNA and tRNAs, $\alpha$ satellites derived from snoRNAs and SL RNAs derived from U1 small nuclear RNA. Furthermore, we present novel putative human repeat-derived ncRNAs obtained by the comparison of the Dfam and Rfam databases, as well as several examples in other species. We hypothesize that novel functional ncRNAs can derive also from other repetitive regions and propose Genomic SELEX as a tool for their identification.},

abstract = {After transcription of a eukaryotic pre-mRNA, its introns are removed by the spliceosome, joining exons for translation. The intron products of splicing have long been considered 'junk' and destined only for destruction. But because they are large in size and under weak selection constraints, many introns have been evolutionarily repurposed to serve roles after splicing. Some spliced introns are precursors for further processing of other encoded RNAs such as small nucleolar RNAs, microRNAs, and long noncoding RNAs. Other intron products have long half-lives and can be exported to the cytoplasm, suggesting that they have roles in translation. Some viruses encode introns that accumulate after splicing and play important but mysterious roles in viral latency. Turnover of most lariat-introns is initiated by cleavage of their internal 2'-5' phosphodiester bonds by a unique debranching endonuclease, and the linear products are further degraded by exoribonucleases. However, several introns appear to evade this turnover pathway and the determinants of their stability are largely unknown. Whereas many stable intron products were discovered serendipitously, new experimental and computational tools will enable their direct identification and study. Finally, the origins and mechanisms of mobility of eukaryotic introns are mysterious, and mechanistic studies of the intron life cycle may yield new insights into how they arose and became widespread.},

Recent developments in two areas of biology are changing the situation rapidly: structural biology has revealed details about enzymes and associated bioreactions at an atomic level; and synthetic biology has provided tools to design and assemble precisely controllable modules for re-programming cellular metabolic circuitry. However, because of different emphases, to date, these two areas have developed separately. A linkage between them is desirable to harness their concerted potential. We therefore propose structural synthetic biotechnology as a new field in biotechnology, specifically for application to the development of industrial microbial strains.},

abstract = {The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial process during normal development that allows dynamic and reversible shifts between epithelial and mesenchymal cell states. Cancer cells take advantage of the complex, interrelated cellular networks that regulate EMT to promote their migratory and invasive capabilities. During the past few years, evidence has accumulated that indicates that genetic mutations and changes to epigenetic mechanisms are key drivers of EMT in cancer cells. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the epigenetic reprogramming in cancer cells that enables them to switch from a noninvasive form to an invasive, metastatic form. The authors review the current knowledge of alterations of epigenetic machinery, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome remodeling and expression of microRNAs, associated with EMT and tumor progression of breast cancer cells. Last, existing and upcoming drug therapies targeting epigenetic regulators and their potential benefit for developing novel treatment strategies are discussed.},

abstract = {Quantum dots nanoparticles have novel optical properties for biomedical applications and electronics, but little is known about their skin permeability and interaction with cells. QD621 are nail-shaped nanoparticles that contain a cadmium/selenide core with a cadmium sulfide shell coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and are soluble in water. QD were topically applied to porcine skin flow-through diffusion cells to assess penetration at 1 microM, 2 microM and 10 microM for 24 h. QD were also studied in human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) to determine cellular uptake, cytotoxicity and inflammatory potential. Confocal microscopy depicted the penetration of QD621 through the uppermost stratum corneum (SC) layers of the epidermis and fluorescence was found primarily in the SC and near hair follicles. QD were found in the intercellular lipid bilayers of the SC by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis for cadmium (Cd) and fluorescence for QD both did not detect Cd nor fluorescence signal in the perfusate at any time point or concentration. In HEK, viability decreased significantly (p{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.05) from 1.25 nM to 10 nM after 24 h and 48 h. There was a significant increase in IL-6 at 1.25 nM to 10 nM, while IL-8 increased from 2.5 nM to 10 nM after 24 h and 48 h. TEM of HEK treated with 10 nM of QD621 at 24 h depicted QD in cytoplasmic vacuoles and at the periphery of the cell membranes. These results indicate that porcine skin penetration of QD621 is minimal and limited primarily to the outer SC layers, yet if the skin were damaged allowing direct QD exposure to skin or keratinocytes, an inflammatory response could be initiated.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest on nanoparticle safety for topical use. The benefits of nanoparticles have been shown in several scientific fields, but little is known about their potential to penetrate the skin. This study aims at evaluating in vitro skin penetration of silver nanoparticles. Experiments were performed using the Franz diffusion cell method with intact and damaged human skin. Physiological solution was used as receiving phase and 70 microg/cm2 of silver nanoparticles coated with polyvinylpirrolidone dispersed in synthetic sweat were applied as donor phase to the outer surface of the skin for 24h. The receptor fluid measurements were performed by electro thermal atomic absorption spectroscopy (ETAAS). Human skin penetration was also determined by using transmission electron microscope (TEM) to verify the location of silver nanoparticles in exposed membranes. Median silver concentrations of 0.46 ng cm(-2) (range {\{}{\textless}{\}}LOD-2.23) and 2.32 ng cm(-2) (range 0.43-11.6) were found in the receiving solutions of cells where the nanoparticles solution was applied on intact skin (eight cells) and on damaged skin (eight cells), respectively. Twenty-four hours silver flux permeation in damaged skin was 0.62+/-0.2 ng cm(-2) with a lag time {\{}{\textless}{\}}1h. Our experimental data showed that silver nanoparticles absorption through intact and damaged skin was very low but detectable, and that in case of damaged skin it was possible an increasing permeation of silver applied as nanoparticles. Moreover, silver nanoparticles could be detected in the stratum corneum and the outermost surface of the epidermis by electron microscopy. We demonstrated for the first time that silver applied as nanoparticles coated with polyvinylpirrolidone is able to permeate the damaged skin in an in vitro diffusion cell system.},

In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci show conjugation between a cell and its bud, or between independent cells. Ascospores are globose, ovoid, or lenticular and have smooth or warty walls that may also have spiral ridges. Ascospores are not liberated from the ascus except in one species. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that fermentation is positive, weak, or absent. Nitrate is not assimilated. The major ubiquinone is CoQ-9. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative.

Growth of fungi and bacteria from soils around Rothera Research Station (Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula) was assessed in the presence of ten separate aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons [marine gas oil (MGO), dodecane, hexadecane, benzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, toluene, phenol, biphenyl, naphthalene and m- and p-xylenes with ethylbenzene]. Aromatic hydrocarbons inhibited soil microbial growth more than aliphatic hydrocarbons. Soil microorganisms from a moss patch, where little previous impact or hydrocarbon contamination had occurred, were less tolerant of hydrocarbons than those from high impact sites. Fungal growth rates of Mollisia sp., Penicillium commune, Mortierella sp., Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma sp. and Phoma herbarum were assessed in the presence of hydrocarbons. Generally, aromatic hydrocarbons inhibited or stopped hyphal extension, though growth rates increased with some aliphatic hydrocarbons. Hyphal dry weight measurements suggested that Mortierella sp. may be able to use dodecane as sole carbon and energy source. Hydrocarbon-degrading Antarctic fungi may have use in future hydrocarbon spill bioremediation.},

abstract = {To study the role of the lumenal binding protein (BiP) in the transport and secretion of proteins, we have produced plants with altered BiP levels. Transgenic plants overexpressing BiP showed dramatically increased BiP mRNA levels but only a modest increase in BiP protein levels. The presence of degradation products in BiP overproducers suggests a regulatory mechanism that increases protein turnover when BiP is abundant. Antisense inhibition of BiP synthesis was not successful, demonstrating that even a minor reduction in the basal BiP level is deleterious to cell viability. Overexpression of BiP leads to downregulation of the basal transcript levels of endogenous BiP genes and greatly reduces the unfolded protein response. The data confirm that BiP transcription is regulated via a feedback mechanism that involves monitoring of BiP protein levels. To test BiP activity in vivo, we designed a functional assay, using the secretory protein alpha-amylase and a cytosolic enzyme as a control for cell viability. During tunicamycin treatment, an overall reduction of alpha-amylase synthesis was observed when compared with the cytosolic marker. We show that the tunicamycin effect is due to the depletion of BiP in the endoplasmic reticulum because coexpressed BiP alone is able to restore efficient alpha-amylase synthesis. This is a novel assay to monitor BiP activity in promoting secretory protein synthesis in vivo.},

abstract = {Cerebral phaeohyphomycosis is a fungal infection of the brain typically caused by Cladophialophora bantiana, Exophiala dermatitidis, and Rhinocladiella mackenziei, all of which belong to the order Chaetothyriales. The disease results in black, necrotic brain tissue, black pus, and black cerebrospinal fluid. Pathogens usually reach the brain through the bloodstream or lymphatic fluid and occasionally through direct spreading or accidental inoculation. Patients can present with hemiparesis, tonic spasm, headache, fever, sensory variation, cerebral irritation, and even psychotic behavioural changes. Radiological images are characterised by ring-enhanced signs and hyperdense and hypodense lesions. Pathological features frequently include black-to-brown necrotic tissue or dark-coloured pus, granulomatous inflammation, giant cell vasculitis, and pigmented fungal elements, which are easily seen on a direct potassium hydroxide smear, a rapid method for diagnosis. Black fungi can be cultured from a biopsy specimen. Combined antifungal chemotherapy, surgical debridement, and careful immunological interventions are strongly recommended to eradicate these intractable infections.},

abstract = {The potential and benefits of nanoparticles in nanobiotechnology have been enthusiastically discussed in recent literature; however, little is known about the potential risks of contamination by accidental contact during production or use. Although theories of transdermal drug delivery suggest that skin structure and composition do not allow the penetration of materials larger than 600 Da, some articles on particle penetration into the skin have been recently published. Consequently, we wanted to evaluate whether metallic nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm could penetrate and eventually permeate the skin. Two different stabilized nanoparticle dispersions were applied to excised human skin samples using vertical diffusion cells. At established time points, solutions in receiving chambers were quantified for nanoparticle concentration, and skin was processed for light transmission and electron microscope examination. The results of this study showed that nanoparticles were able to penetrate the hair follicle and stratum corneum (SC), occasionally reaching the viable epidermis. Yet, nanoparticles were unable to permeate the skin. These results represent a breakthrough in skin penetration because it is early evidence where rigid nanoparticles have been shown to passively reach the viable epidermis through the SC lipidic matrix.},

Actin 1 (ACT1) gene sequences coupled with AFLP markers showed that the investigated yeasts belonged to the recently reinstated species D. hansenii, D. fabryi and D. tyrocola. The strain HA1179 was supposed to be a D. hansenii strain with introgressed D. fabryi DNA segments. This strain acquired ribosomal RNA encoding genes (rDNA) and the ACT1 gene from the species D. fabryi and D. hansenii respectively. Comparative sequence analysis of the ACT1 gene, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (5.8S-ITSs) and D1/D2 regions, suggested that five strains isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment plant could represent a new taxon of the genus, for which the name Debaryomyces vindobonensis was proposed. The calculated degree of similarity between the AFLP patterns indicated that the strains of D. vindobonensis and the closely related species were separated by the values ＜0.5. New yeast isolates showed very similar morphological and physiological properties to related Debaryomyces species.

abstract = {The study of fungal regulatory networks is essential to the understanding of how these pathogens respond to host environmental signals with effective virulence-associated traits. In this study, a virulence-associated DEAD-box RNA helicase-encoding gene (VAD1) was isolated from a mutant defective in the virulence factor laccase. A Deltavad1 mutant exhibited a profound reduction in virulence in a mouse model that was restored after reconstitution with WT VAD1. Loss of VAD1 resulted in upregulation of NOT1, a gene encoding a global repressor of transcription. NOT1 was found to act as an intermediary transcriptional repressor of laccase. Vad1 was located within macromolecular complexes that formed cytoplasmic granular bodies in mature cells and during infection of mouse brain. In addition, VAD1 was shown by in situ hybridization to be expressed in the brain of an AIDS patient coinfected with C. neoformans. To understand the role of VAD1 in virulence, a functional genomics approach was used to identify 3 additional virulence determinants dependent on VAD1: PCK1, TUF1, and MPF3, involved in gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial protein synthesis, and cell wall integrity, respectively. These data show that fungal virulence-associated genes are coordinately regulated and that an analysis of such transcriptomes allows for the identification of important new genes involved in the normal growth and virulence of fungal pathogens.},

abstract = {Nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase) is a very abundant protein secreted by the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii shortly after invasion of the host cell. When activated by dithiols, NTPase is one of the most potent apyrases known to date, but its physiological function remains unknown. The genes encoding NTPase have been cloned (Bermudes, D., Peck, K. R., Afifi-Afifi, M., Beckers, C. J. M., and Joiner, K. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29252-29260). We have recently shown that the enzyme is tightly controlled within the vacuolar space and may influence parasite exit from the host cell (Silverman, J. A., Qi, H., Riehl, A., Beckers, C., Nakaar, V., and Joiner, K. A (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 12352-12359). In the present study, we have generated an antisense NTP RNA construct in which the 3'-untranslated region is replaced by a hammerhead ribozyme. The constitutive synthesis of the chimeric antisense RNA-ribozyme construct in parasites that were stably transfected with this construct resulted in a dramatic reduction in the steady-state levels of NTPase. This inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the capacity of the parasites to replicate. The reduction in parasite proliferation was due to a specific effect of antisense NTP RNA, since a drastic inhibition of hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HXGPRT) expression by a chimeric antisense HXGPRT RNA-ribozyme construct did not alter NTPase expression nor compromise parasite replication. These data implicate NTPase in an essential parasite function and suggest that NTPase may have more than one function in vivo. These results also establish that it is possible to study gene function in apicomplexan parasites using antisense RNA coupled to ribozymes.},

abstract = {Adaptation to extracytoplasmic stress in Escherichia coli depends on the activation of sigmaE, normally sequestered by the membrane protein RseA. SigmaE is released in response to stress through the successive RseA cleavage by DegS and the RIP protease RseP. SigmaE and proteases that free it from RseA are essential. We isolated a multicopy suppressor that alleviated RseP and DegS requirement. The suppressor encodes a novel small RNA, RseX. Its activity required the RNA-binding protein Hfq. We used the property that small RNAs are often involved in RNA-RNA interactions to capture RseX putative partners; ompA and ompC mRNA, which encode two major outer membrane proteins, were identified. RseX activity was shown to confer an Hfq-dependent coordinate OmpA and OmpC down-regulation. Because RseP is shown to be no longer essential in a strain lacking OmpA and OmpC, we conclude that RseP, which is required for normal sigmaE activation, prevents toxicity due to the presence of two specific outer membrane proteins that are down-regulated by RseX.},

Cutaneous production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is a primary system for protection, and expression of some AMPs further increases in response to microbial invasion. Cathelicidins are unique AMPs that protect the skin through 2 distinct pathways: (1) direct antimicrobial activity and (2) initiation of a host response resulting in cytokine release, inflammation, angiogenesis, and reepithelialization. Cathelicidin dysfunction emerges as a central factor in the pathogenesis of several cutaneous diseases, including atopic dermatitis, in which cathelicidin is suppressed; rosacea, in which cathelicidin peptides are abnormally processed to forms that induce inflammation; and psoriasis, in which cathelicidin peptide converts self-DNA to a potent stimulus in an autoinflammatory cascade. Recent work identified vitamin D3 as a major factor involved in the regulation of cathelicidin. Therapies targeting control of cathelicidin and other AMPs might provide new approaches in the management of infectious and inflammatory skin diseases.},

For experimental evolution, new artificial RNA aptamers and RNA enzymes (ribozymes) have been selected in vitro. These functional RNA molecules are likely to be applicable in the reprogramming of existing gene regulatory systems. Furthermore, they may be used for designing hypothetical RNA-based living systems in the so-called RNA world. For the regulation of gene expressions in living cells, the development of new riboswitches allows us to modulate the target gene expression in a tailor-made manner. Moreover, recently RNA-based synthetic genetic circuits have been reported by employing functional RNA molecules, expanding the repertory of synthetic biology with RNA motifs.},

abstract = {Improvement to the life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) brings about novel challenges including the need for evaluation of the role of fungi in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. To determine if such organisms represent bystanders or pathogens affecting clinical outcomes we review the existing knowledge from a clinical, biochemical, inflammatory and immunological perspective. The prevalence and importance of fungi in the CF airway has likely been underestimated with the most frequently isolated filamentous fungi being Aspergillus fumigatus and Scedosporium apiospermum and the major yeast Candida albicans. Developing non-culture based microbiological methods for fungal detection has improved both our classification and understanding of their clinical consequences including localized, allergic and systemic infections. Cross-kingdom interaction between bacteria and fungi are discussed as is the role of biofilms further affecting clinical outcome. A combination of host and pathogen-derived factors determines if a particular fungus represents a commensal, colonizer or pathogen in the setting of CF. The underlying immune state, disease severity and treatment burden represent key host variables whilst fungal type, form, chronicity and virulence including the ability to evade immune recognition determines the pathogenic potential of a specific fungus at a particular point in time. Further research in this emerging field is warranted to fully elucidate the spectrum of disease conferred by the presence of fungi in the CF airway and the indications for therapeutic interventions.

abstract = {Improvement to the life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) brings about novel challenges including the need for evaluation of the role of fungi in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. To determine if such organisms represent bystanders or pathogens affecting clinical outcomes we review the existing knowledge from a clinical, biochemical, inflammatory and immunological perspective. The prevalence and importance of fungi in the CF airway has likely been underestimated with the most frequently isolated filamentous fungi being Aspergillus fumigatus and Scedosporium apiospermum and the major yeast Candida albicans. Developing non-culture based microbiological methods for fungal detection has improved both our classification and understanding of their clinical consequences including localized, allergic and systemic infections. Cross-kingdom interaction between bacteria and fungi are discussed as is the role of biofilms further affecting clinical outcome. A combination of host and pathogen-derived factors determines if a particular fungus represents a commensal, colonizer or pathogen in the setting of CF. The underlying immune state, disease severity and treatment burden represent key host variables whilst fungal type, form, chronicity and virulence including the ability to evade immune recognition determines the pathogenic potential of a specific fungus at a particular point in time. Further research in this emerging field is warranted to fully elucidate the spectrum of disease conferred by the presence of fungi in the CF airway and the indications for therapeutic interventions.

abstract = {Although the cold-shock response has now been studied in a number of different organisms for several decades, it is only in the last few years that we have begun to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern adaptation to cold stress. Notably, all organisms from prokaryotes to plants and higher eukaryotes respond to cold shock in a comparatively similar manner. The general response of cells to cold stress is the elite and rapid overexpression of a small group of proteins, the so-called CSPs (cold-shock proteins). The most well characterized CSP is CspA, the major CSP expressed in Escherichia coli upon temperature downshift. More recently, a number of reports have shown that exposing yeast or mammalian cells to sub-physiological temperatures ({\textless}30 or {\textless}37 degrees C respectively) invokes a co-ordinated cellular response involving modulation of transcription, translation, metabolism, the cell cycle and the cell cytoskeleton. In the present review, we summarize the regulation and role of cold-shock genes and proteins in the adaptive response upon decreased temperature with particular reference to yeast and in vitro cultured mammalian cells. Finally, we present an integrated model for the co-ordinated responses required to maintain the viability and integrity of mammalian cells upon mild hypothermic cold shock.},

abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been widely used ({\textgreater}2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

abstract = {Melanised rock-inhabiting fungi are astonishingly resistant to environmental stresses. Also known as micro-colonial fungi (MCF), they are ubiquitous and even colonise bare rocks in deserts. To survive in nutrient poor and extremely stressful conditions, MCF have reduced morphogenetic complexity to a minimum, and rely on a broad spectrum of stress protection mechanisms. Although visual signs of carotenoid presence are masked by heavily melanised black cell-walls, we were able to isolate and characterise a variety of carotenoids (ss-carotene, zeta-carotene, phytoene, torularhodin and torulene) in the rock-inhabiting, relatively fast-growing strain A95. The desiccation/rehydration stress response was used to measure the ability of A95 to adapt to slow or fast changes in external conditions. Revival of MCF after prolonged desiccation and rehydration was documented by biochemical (analyses of lipids and protective pigments), cultivation, and microscopic methods. Survival of MCF is enhanced when desiccation is rapid and mycostasis is instant rather than following prolonged periods of low metabolic activity.},

Here, we describe three novel genes encoding fatty-acid-modifying enzymes in A. pullulans, along with the levels of their mRNAs under different salinity conditions. High levels of Delta(9)-desaturase and Delta(12)-desaturase mRNAs were seen at high salinities, which were consistent with an increased desaturation of the fatty acids in the cell membranes. Elevated levels of elongase mRNA were also detected. Surprisingly, increases in the levels of these mRNAs were also seen following hypo-osmotic shock, while hyperosmotic shock had exactly the opposite effect, demonstrating that data that are obtained from up-shift and down-shift salinity studies should be interpreted with caution.},

Considerable differences in predilection, clinical course and localization are noted between species. Ochroconis gallopava is a mild cerebral opportunist, causing brain lesions in humans only when innate defense is severely impaired. Ramichloridium mackenziei is endemic to the Middle East. Exophiala dermatitidis occurs worldwide, but cerebral infection is thus far limited to humans of the East Asian Oriental race. Neurotropic infections by this species are generally not limited to the brain. Frequently cervical lymph node inflammation is among the first symptoms of infection. Cladophialophora bantiana is an organism with rapid in vivo growth, causing acute infections with cerebral edema shortly after onset of disease. Severe headache and paralysis of the limbs are among the first symptoms. When untreated, brain infections by this fungus are nearly always fatal. The species occurs worldwide, but brain infections are relatively rare in the Far East. C. bantiana, E. dermatitidis and R. mackenziei are mutually related as purported anamorph members of the ascomycete family Herpotrichiellaceae, and all are remarkable by their potential ability to cause fatal brain disease in otherwise healthy patients.},

abstract = {The ;black yeast' Exophiala oligosperma R1 can utilise various organic nitriles under acidic conditions as nitrogen sources. The induction of a phenylacetonitrile converting activity was optimised by growing the strain in the presence of different nitriles and /or complex or inorganic nitrogen sources. The highest nitrile hydrolysing activity was observed with cells grown with 2-cyanopyridine and NaNO(3). The cells metabolised the inducer and grew with 2-cyanopyridine as sole source of nitrogen. Cell extracts converted various (substituted) benzonitriles and phenylacetonitriles. They usually converted the isomers carrying a substituent in the meta-position with higher relative activities than the corresponding para- or ortho-substituted isomers. Aliphatic substrates such as acrylonitrile and 2-hydroxy-3-butenenitrile were also hydrolysed. The highest specific activity was detected with 4-cyanopyridine. Most nitriles were almost exclusively converted to the corresponding acids and no or only low amounts of the corresponding amides were formed. The cells hydrolysed amides only with extremely low activities. It was therefore concluded that the cells harboured a nitrilase activity. The specific activities of whole cells and cell extracts were compared for different nitriles and evidence obtained for limitation in the substrate-uptake by whole cells. The conversion of 2-hydroxy-3-butenenitrile to 2-hydroxy-3-butenoic acid at pH 4 demonstrated the unique ability of cells of E. oligosperma R1 to hydrolyse aliphatic alpha-hydroxynitriles under acidic conditions. The organism could grow with phenylacetonitrile as sole source of carbon, energy and nitrogen. The degradation of phenylacetonitrile presumably proceeds via phenylacetic acid, 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (homogentisate), maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate.},

In search of its natural habitat, a large sampling was undertaken in temperate as well as in tropical climates. Sampling sites were selected on the basis of the origins of previously isolated strains, and on the basis of physiological properties of the species, which also determined a selective isolation protocol. The species was absent from outdoor environments in the temperate climate, but present at low abundance in comparable habitats in the tropics. Positive outdoor sites particularly included faeces of frugivorous birds and bats, in urban as well as in natural areas. Tropical fruits were found E. dermatitidis positive at low incidence. Of the human-made environments sampled, railway ties contaminated by human faeces and oily debris in the tropics were massively positive, while the known abundance of the fungus in steam baths was confirmed. On the basis of the species' oligotrophy, thermotolerance, acidotolerance, moderate osmotolerance, melanization and capsular yeast cells a natural life cycle in association with frugivorous animals in foci in the tropical rain forest, involving passage of living cells through the intestinal tract was hypothesized.

To characterise the genetic variability of Aureobasidium pullulans strains originating from the Arctic and strains originating pan-globally, a multilocus molecular analysis was performed, through rDNA (internal transcribed spacers, partial 28 S rDNA), and partial introns and exons of genes encoding beta-tubulin (TUB), translation elongation factor (EF1alpha) and elongase (ELO). Two globally ubiquitous varieties were distinguished: var. pullulans, occurring particularly in slightly osmotic substrates and in the phyllosphere; and var. melanogenum, mainly isolated from watery habitats. Both varieties were commonly isolated from the sampled Arctic habitats. However, some aureobasidium-like strains from subglacial ice from three different glaciers in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, Spitsbergen), appeared to represent a new variety of A. pullulans. A strain from dolomitic marble in Namibia was found to belong to yet another variety. No molecular support has as yet been found for the previously described var. aubasidani. A partial elongase-encoding gene was successfully used as a phylogenetic marker at the (infra-)specific level.},

In addition, cultural and temperature preferences were investigated. The phylogenetic positions of species recognised were determined by SSU rDNA sequencing. Most species showed affinity to the Dothideomycetidae and constitute two main groups referred to under the generic names Friedmanniomyces and Cryomyces (gen. nov.), each characterised by a clearly distinct morphology. Two species could be distinguished in each of these genera. Six strains could not be assigned to any taxonomic group; among them strain CCFEE 457 belongs to the Hysteriales, clustering together with Mediterranean marble-inhabiting Coniosporium species in an approximate group with low bootstrap support. All strains proved to be psychrophiles with the only exception for the strain CCFEE 507 that seems to be mesophilic- psychrotolerant. All had very thick melanised cell walls, the ability to produce exopolysaccharides and to grow meristematically. They are thought to be well adapted to the harsh environment of the Antarctic cold Desert. Hypotheses concerning their origin and evolution are put forward. Taxonomic},

abstract = {Neurosphereforming cell (NSFC) lines have been established from cultures
of human adult olfactory neuroepithelium. Few of these cells ever
express mature neuronal or glial markers in minimal essential medium
supplemented with 10{\%} fetal bovine serum or defined medium. However,
these neural progenitors have the potential to differentiate along
glial or neuronal lineages. To evaluate the potential of NSFCs to
form motoneurons, transcription factors Olig2, Ngn2, and HB9 were
introduced into NSFCs to determine if their expression is sufficient
for motoneuron specification and differentiation, as has been shown
in the early development of the avian and murine central nervous
systems in vivo. NSFCs transfected with Olig2, Ngn2, and HB9 alone
exhibited no phenotypic lineage restriction. In contrast, simultaneous
transfection of Ngn2 and HB9 cDNA increased the expression of Isl1/2,
a motoneuron marker, when the cells were maintained in medium supplemented
with retinoic acid, forskolin, and sonic hedgehog. Furthermore, a
population of Olig2-expressing NSFCs also expressed Ngn2. Cotransfection
of NSFCs with Olig2 and HB9, but not Olig2 and Ngn2, increased Isl1/2
expression. Coculture of NSFCs trans-fected with Ngn2-HB92 or Olig2
and HB9 with purified chicken skeletal muscle demonstrated frequent
contacts that resembled neuromuscular junctions. These studies demonstrate
that transcription factors governing the early development of chick
and mouse motoneuron formation are able to drive human adult olfactory
neuroepithelial progenitors to differentiate into motoneurons in
vitro. Our long-term goal is to develop cell populations for future
studies of the therapeutic utility of these olfactory-derived NSFCs
for autologous cell replacement strategies for central nervous system
trauma and neurodegenerative diseases.},

Extracellular peroxidases and laccases have been shown to oxidize recalcitrant compounds in vitro but the likely significance of individual enzyme levels in vivo remains unclear. This study documents the amounts and activities of Mn-dependent peroxidase (MnP), lignin peroxidase and laccase (LAC) in various species of ligninolytic fungi grown in liquid medium and soil and their effect on degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene and pyrene), a polychlorinated biphenyl mixture (Delor 106) and a number of synthetic dyes. Stationary cultures of a highly degradative strain Irpex lacteus exhibited 380-fold and 2-fold increase in production of MnP and LAC, respectively, compared to submerged cultures. Addition of Tween 80 to the submerged culture increased MnP levels 260-fold. High levels of MnP correlated with efficient decolorization of Reactive Orange 16 azo dye but not of Remazol Brilliant Blue R anthraquinone dye. Degradation of anthracene and pyrene in spiked soil by straw-grown explorative mycelium of Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus showed the importance of MnP and LAC levels secreted into the soil. The importance of high fungal enzyme levels for efficient degradation of recalcitrant compounds was better demonstrated in liquid media compared to the same strains growing in soil.},

Fungal EVs contain a complex combination of macromolecules, including proteins, lipids and glycans. In this work, we aimed to describe and characterize RNA in EV preparations from the human pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans, Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis and Candida albicans, and from the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The EV RNA content consisted mostly of molecules less than 250 nt long and the reads obtained aligned with intergenic and intronic regions or specific positions within the mRNA. We identified 114 ncRNAs, among them, six small nucleolar (snoRNA), two small nuclear (snRNA), two ribosomal (rRNA) and one transfer (tRNA) common to all the species considered, together with 20 sequences with features consistent with miRNAs. We also observed some copurified mRNAs, as suggested by reads covering entire transcripts, including those involved in vesicle-mediated transport and metabolic pathways. We characterized for the first time RNA molecules present in EVs produced by fungi. Our results suggest that RNA-containing vesicles may be determinant for various biological processes, including cell communication and pathogenesis.},

We discovered subtype specific differentially spliced genes and splice isoforms not previously recognized in human transcriptome. Further, we showed that exon skip and intron retention are predominant splice events in breast cancer. In addition, we found that differential expression of primary transcripts and promoter switching are significantly deregulated in breast cancer compared to normal breast. We validated the presence of novel hybrid isoforms of critical molecules like CDK4, LARP1, ADD3, and PHLPP2. Our study provides the first comprehensive portrait of transcriptional and splicing signatures specific to breast cancer sub-types, as well as previously unknown transcripts that prompt the need for complete annotation of tissue and disease specific transcriptome.},

abstract = {A selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) method was developed for a streamlined sample preparation/cleanup to determine Aroclors and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil and sediment. The SPLE was coupled with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for an effective analytical approach for environmental monitoring. Sediment or soil samples were extracted with alumina, 10{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} AgNO3 in silica, and sulfuric acid impregnated silica with dichloromethane at 100°C and 2000psi. The SPLE offered simultaneous extraction and cleanup of the PCBs and Aroclors, eliminating the need for a post-extraction cleanup prior to ELISA. Two different ELISA methods: (1) an Aroclor ELISA and (2) a coplanar PCB ELISA were evaluated. The Aroclor ELISA utilized a polyclonal antibody (Ab) with Aroclor 1254 as the calibrant and the coplanar PCB ELISA kit used a rabbit coplanar PCB Ab with PCB-126 as the calibrant. Recoveries of Aroclor 1254 in two reference soil samples were 92±2{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} and 106±5{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} by off-line coupling of SPLE with ELISA. The average recovery of Aroclor 1254 in spiked soil and sediment samples was 92±17{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}. Quantitative recoveries of coplanar PCBs (107–117{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) in spiked samples were obtained with the combined SPLE–ELISA. The estimated method detection limit was 10ngg−1for Aroclor 1254 and 125pgg−1 for PCB-126. Estimated sample throughput for the SPLE–ELISA was about twice that of the stepwise extraction/cleanup needed for gas chromatography (GC) or GC/mass spectrometry (MS) detection. ELISA-derived uncorrected and corrected Aroclor 1254 levels correlated well (r=0.9973 and 0.9996) with the total Aroclor concentrations as measured by GC for samples from five different contaminated sites. ELISA-derived PCB-126 concentrations were higher than the sums of the 12 coplanar PCBs generated by GC/MS with a positive correlation (r=0.9441). Results indicate that the SPLE–ELISA approach can be used for quantitative or qualitative analysis of PCBs in soil and sediments. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an SPLE–ELISA approach not requiring a post-extraction cleanup step for detecting Aroclors and coplanar PCBs in soil and sediment.},

The absence of facile molecular genetics has been a major impediment to analysis of pathogenesis. The lack of meiosis coupled with the absence of plasmids makes genetic engineering cumbersome, especially for essential functions and gene families. We describe a C. albicans CRISPR system that overcomes many of the obstacles to genetic engineering in this organism. The high frequency with which CRISPR-induced mutations can be directed to target genes enables easy isolation of homozygous gene knockouts, even without selection. Moreover, the system permits the creation of strains with mutations in multiple genes, gene families, and genes that encode essential functions. This CRISPR system is also effective in a fresh clinical isolate of undetermined ploidy. Our method transforms the ability to manipulate the genome of Candida and provides a new window into the biology of this pathogen.},

Yet in certain rock types a narrow subsurface zone has a favorable microclimate and is colonized by microorganisms. Dominant are lichens of unusual organization. They survive not by physiological adaptation to lower temperatures, but by changing their mode of growth, being able to grow between the crystals of porous rocks. Their activity results in mobilization of iron compounds and in rock weatherning with a characteristic pattern of exfoliation. This simple ecosystem lacks both higher consumers and predators.},

abstract = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the silencing of invading nucleic acids. We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.},

The Arabidopsis ago1 mutant exhibits reduced susceptibility to B. cinerea, and the B. cinerea dcl1 dcl2 double mutant that can no longer produce these Bc-sRNAs displays reduced pathogenicity on Arabidopsis and tomato.

character, thereby orienting the heterodimer on the siRNA duplex.
Strong R2D2 binding requires a 5'-phosphate on the siRNA strand that

Mutant embryos do not process precursor miRNAs into mature miRNAs, but injection of preprocessed miRNAs restores gene silencing, indicating that the disrupted domains are dispensable for later steps in silencing. MZdicer mutants undergo axis formation and differentiate multiple cell types but display abnormal morphogenesis during gastrulation, brain formation, somitogenesis, and heart development.

In contrast, IGF-2 stimulates healing only when used in combination with IGFBP-1.

Here, we reanalyze a series of published RNA-seq data sets, screening them specifically for non-contiguously mapping reads. We recover most of the known cases together with several novel archaeal ncRNAs associated with circularized products. In Eubacteria, only a handful of interesting candidates were obtained beyond a few previously described group I and group II introns. Most of the atypically mapping reads do not appear to correspond to well-defined, specifically processed products. Whether this diffuse background is, at least in part, an incidental by-product of prokaryotic RNA processing or whether it consists entirely of technical artifacts of reverse transcription or amplification remains unknown.},

It uses an explicit statistical model with no machine learning component and can therefore be applied "out of the box," without any training, to data from all domains of life. We describe the RNAcode method and apply it in combination with mass spectrometry experiments to predict and confirm seven novel short peptides in Escherichia coli and to analyze the coding potential of RNAs previously annotated as "noncoding."

abstract = {Archaeal RNA splicing involves at least two protein enzymes, a specific endonuclease and a specific ligase. The endonuclease recognizes and cleaves within a characteristic bulge-helix-bulge (BHB) structure formed by pairing of the regions near the two exon-intron junctions, producing 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl termini. The ligase joins the exons and converts the cyclic phosphate into junction phosphate. The ligated product contains a seven-base hairpin loop, in which the splice junction is in between the two 3' terminal residues of the loop. Archaeal splicing endonucleases are also involved in rRNA processing, cutting within the BHB structures formed by pairing of the 5' and 3' flanking regions of the rRNAs. Large free introns derived from pre-rRNAs have been observed as stable and abundant circular RNAs in certain Crenarchaeota, a kingdom in the domain Archaea. In the present study, we show that the cells of Haloferax volcanii, a Euryarchaeote, contain circular RNAs formed by 3',5'-phosphodiester linkage between the two termini of the introns derived from their pre-tRNAs. H. volcanii ligase, in vitro, can also circularize both endonuclease-cleaved introns, and non-endonuclease-produced substrates. Exon joining and intron circularization are mechanistically similar ligation reactions that can occur independently. The size of the ligated hairpin loop and position of the splice junction within this loop can be changed in in vitro ligation reactions. Overall, archaeal RNA splicing seems to involve two sets of two symmetric transesterification reactions each.},

abstract = {Recent large-scale transcriptome analyses have revealed that large numbers of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are transcribed from mammalian genomes. They include small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and longer ncRNAs, many of which are localized to the nucleus, but which have remained functionally elusive. Since ncRNAs are only known to exist in mammalian species, established experimental systems, including the Xenopus oocyte system and yeast genetics, are not available for functional analysis. RNA interference (RNAi), commonly used for analysis of protein-coding genes, is effective in eliminating cytoplasmic mRNAs, but not nuclear RNAs. To circumvent this problem, we have refined the system for knockdown of nuclear ncRNAs with chemically modified chimeric antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that were efficiently introduced into the nucleus by nucleofection. Under optimized conditions, our system appeared to degrade at least 20 different nuclear ncRNA species in multiple mammalian cell lines with high efficiency and specificity. We also confirmed that our method had greatly improved knockdown efficiency compared with that of the previously reported method in which ASOs are introduced with transfection reagents. Furthermore, we have confirmed the expected phenotypic alterations following knockdown of HBII295 snoRNA and U7 snRNA, which resulted in a loss of site-specific methylation of the artificial RNA and the appearance of abnormal polyadenylated histone mRNA species with a concomitant delay of the cell cycle S phase, respectively. In summary, we believe that our system is a powerful tool to explore the biological functions of the large number of nuclear ncRNAs with unknown function.},

abstract = {A majority of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) map to noncoding and intergenic regions of the genome. Noncoding SNPs are often identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as strongly associated with human disease. Two such disease-associated SNPs in the 5' UTR of the human FTL (Ferritin Light Chain) gene are predicted to alter the ensemble of structures adopted by the mRNA. High-accuracy single nucleotide resolution chemical mapping reveals that these SNPs result in substantial changes in the structural ensemble in agreement with the computational prediction. Furthermore six rescue mutations are correctly predicted to restore the mRNA to its wild-type ensemble. Our data confirm that the FTL 5' UTR is a "RiboSNitch," an RNA that changes structure if a particular disease-associated SNP is present. The structural change observed is analogous to that of a bacterial Riboswitch in that it likely regulates translation. These data further suggest that specific pairs of SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) will form RNA structure-stabilizing haplotypes (SSHs). We identified 484 SNP pairs that form SSHs in UTRs of the human genome, and in eight of the 10 SSH-containing transcripts, SNP pairs stabilize RNA protein binding sites. The ubiquitous nature of SSHs in the transcriptome suggests that certain haplotypes are conserved to avoid RiboSNitch formation.},

abstract = {In ribosomal RNA, modified nucleosides are found in functionally important regions, but their function is obscure. Stem-loop 69 of Escherichia coli 23S rRNA contains three modified nucleosides: pseudouridines at positions 1911 and 1917, and N3 methyl-pseudouridine (m(3)Psi) at position 1915. The gene for pseudouridine methyltransferase was previously not known. We identified E. coli protein YbeA as the methyltransferase methylating Psi1915 in 23S rRNA. The E. coli ybeA gene deletion strain lacks the N3 methylation at position 1915 of 23S rRNA as revealed by primer extension and nucleoside analysis by HPLC. Methylation at position 1915 is restored in the ybeA deletion strain when recombinant YbeA protein is expressed from a plasmid. In addition, we show that purified YbeA protein is able to methylate pseudouridine in vitro using 70S ribosomes but not 50S subunits from the ybeA deletion strain as substrate. Pseudouridine is the preferred substrate as revealed by the inability of YbeA to methylate uridine at position 1915. This shows that YbeA is acting at the final stage during ribosome assembly, probably during translation initiation. Hereby, we propose to rename the YbeA protein to RlmH according to uniform nomenclature of RNA methyltransferases. RlmH belongs to the SPOUT superfamily of methyltransferases. RlmH was found to be well conserved in bacteria, and the gene is present in plant and in several archaeal genomes. RlmH is the first pseudouridine specific methyltransferase identified so far and is likely to be the only one existing in bacteria, as m(3)Psi1915 is the only methylated pseudouridine in bacteria described to date.},

abstract = {Conversion of uridines into pseudouridines (Psis) is the most frequent base modification in ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). In eukaryotes, the pseudouridylation sites are specified by base-pairing with specific target sequences within H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). The yeast rRNAs harbor 44 Psis, but, when this work began, 15 Psis had completely unknown guide snoRNAs. This suggested that many snoRNAs remained to be discovered. To address this problem and further complete the snoRNA assignment to Psi sites, we identified the complete set of RNAs associated with the H/ACA snoRNP specific proteins Gar1p and Nhp2p by coupling TAP-tag purifications with genomic DNA microarrays experiments. Surprisingly, while we identified all the previously known H/ACA snoRNAs, we selected only three new snoRNAs. This suggested that most of the missing Psi guides were present in previously known snoRNAs but had been overlooked. We confirmed this hypothesis by systematically investigating the role of previously known, as well as of the newly identified snoRNAs, in specifying rRNA Psi sites and found all but one missing guide RNAs. During the completion of this work, another study, based on bioinformatic predictions, also reported the identification of most missing guide RNAs. Altogether, all Psi guides are now identified and we can tell that, in budding yeast, the 44 Psis are guided by 28 snoRNAs. Finally, aside from snR30, an atypical small RNA of heterogeneous length and at least one mRNA, all Gar1p and Nhp2p associated RNAs characterized by our work turned out to be snoRNAs involved in rRNA Psi specification.},

abstract = {Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) guide RNA modification and are localized in nucleoli and Cajal bodies in eukaryotic cells. Components of the RNA silencing pathway associate with these structures, and two recent reports have revealed that a human and a protozoan snoRNA can be processed into miRNA-like RNAs. Here we show that small RNAs with evolutionary conservation of size and position are derived from the vast majority of snoRNA loci in animals (human, mouse, chicken, fruit fly), Arabidopsis, and fission yeast. In animals, sno-derived RNAs (sdRNAs) from H/ACA snoRNAs are predominantly 20-24 nucleotides (nt) in length and originate from the 3' end. Those derived from C/D snoRNAs show a bimodal size distribution at approximately 17-19 nt and {\textgreater}27 nt and predominantly originate from the 5' end. SdRNAs are associated with AGO7 in Arabidopsis and Ago1 in fission yeast with characteristic 5' nucleotide biases and show altered expression patterns in fly loquacious and Dicer-2 and mouse Dicer1 and Dgcr8 mutants. These findings indicate that there is interplay between the RNA silencing and snoRNA-mediated RNA processing systems, and that sdRNAs comprise a novel and ancient class of small RNAs in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are an abundant group of noncoding RNAs mainly involved in the post-transcriptional modifications of rRNAs in eukaryotes. In this study, a large-scale genome-wide analysis of the two major families of snoRNA genes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been performed using experimental and computational RNomics methods. Two hundred and twelve gene variants, encoding 56 box H/ACA and 63 box C/D snoRNAs, were identified, of which 57 novel snoRNAs have been reported for the first time. These snoRNAs were predicted to guide a total of 147 methylations and pseudouridylations on rRNAs and snRNAs, showing a more comprehensive pattern of rRNA modification in the fruit fly. With the exception of nine, all the snoRNAs identified to date in D. melanogaster are intron encoded. Remarkably, the genomic organization of the snoRNAs is characteristic of 8 dUhg genes and 17 intronic gene clusters, demonstrating that distinct organizations dominate the expression of the two families of snoRNAs in the fruit fly. Of the 267 introns in the host genes, more than half have been identified as host introns for coding of snoRNAs. In contrast to mammals, the variation in size of the host introns is mainly due to differences in the number of snoRNAs they contain. These results demonstrate the extensive utilization of introns for coding of snoRNAs in the host genes and shed light on further research of other noncoding RNA genes in the large introns of the Drosophila genome.},

only limited complementarity to the active strand of the RNA duplex.
This process reflects natural target regulation by miRNAs, but is
an unintended ("off-target") consequence of siRNA-mediated silencing.
Here we demonstrate that this unintended off-target silencing is
widespread, and occurs in a manner reminiscent of target silencing
by miRNAs. A high proportion of unintended transcripts silenced by
siRNAs showed 3' UTR sequence complementarity to the seed region
of the siRNA. Base mismatches within the siRNA seed region reduced
the set of original off-target transcripts but generated new sets
of silenced transcripts with sequence complementarity to the mismatched
seed sequence. An inducible shRNA silenced a subset of transcripts
that were silenced by an siRNA of the same sequence, demonstrating
that unintended silencing is sequence mediated and is independent
of delivery method. In all cases, off-target transcript silencing
was accompanied by loss of the corresponding protein and occurred
with dependence on siRNA concentration similar to that of silencing
of the target transcript. Thus, short stretches of sequence complementarity
to the siRNA or shRNA seed region are key to the silencing of unintended
transcripts.},

abstract = {Current genomic screens for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) predict a large number of genomic regions containing potential structural ncRNAs. The analysis of these data requires highly accurate prediction of ncRNA boundaries and discrimination of promising candidate ncRNAs from weak predictions. Existing methods struggle with these goals because they rely on sequence-based multiple sequence alignments, which regularly misalign RNA structure and therefore do not support identification of structural similarities. To overcome this limitation, we compute columnwise and global reliabilities of alignments based on sequence and structure similarity; we refer to these structure-based alignment reliabilities as STARs. The columnwise STARs of alignments, or STAR profiles, provide a versatile tool for the manual and automatic analysis of ncRNAs. In particular, we improve the boundary prediction of the widely used ncRNA gene finder RNAz by a factor of 3 from a median deviation of 47 to 13 nt. Post-processing RNAz predictions, LocARNA-P's STAR score allows much stronger discrimination between true- and false-positive predictions than RNAz's own evaluation. The improved accuracy, in this scenario increased from AUC 0.71 to AUC 0.87, significantly reduces the cost of successive analysis steps. The ready-to-use software tool LocARNA-P produces structure-based multiple RNA alignments with associated columnwise STARs and predicts ncRNA boundaries. We provide additional results, a web server for LocARNA/LocARNA-P, and the software package, including documentation and a pipeline for refining screens for structural ncRNA, at http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Supplements/LocARNA-P/.},

abstract = {DsrA RNA regulates the translation of two global regulatory proteins in Escherichia coli. DsrA activates the translation of RpoS while repressing the translation of H-NS. The RNA-binding protein Hfq is necessary for DsrA to function in vivo. Although Hfq binds to DsrA in vitro, the role of Hfq in DsrA-mediated regulation is not known. One hypothesis was that Hfq acts as an RNA chaperone by unfolding DsrA, thereby facilitating interactions with target RNAs. To test this hypothesis, we have examined the structure of DsrA bound to Hfq in vitro. Comparison of free DsrA to DsrA bound to Hfq by RNase footprinting, circular dichroism, and thermal melt profiles shows that Hfq does not alter DsrA secondary structures, but might affect its tertiary conformation. We identify the site on DsrA where Hfq binds, which is a structural element in the middle of DsrA. In addition, we show that although long poly(U) RNAs compete with DsrA for binding to Hfq, a short poly(U) stretch present in DsrA is not necessary for Hfq binding. Finally, unlike other RNAs, DsrA binding to Hfq is not competed with by poly(A) RNA. In fact, DsrA:poly(A):Hfq may form a stable ternary complex, raising the possibility that Hfq has multiple RNA-binding sites.},

the stability of guide sequence-target RNA base-pairing interaction,
and the distance between the target uridine and the box H or ACA,
were critical for the guide function, as changes in these components
were sufficient to alter the functionality and specificity of the
pseudouridylation pocket. The dynamic functional changes in response
to changes in these three important components were further tested
in vivo, and the results were completely consistent with the in vitro

full RNA duplex. We have studied here the structure of CopA-CopT
complex, combining chemical and enzymatic probing and computer graphic
modeling. CopI, a truncated derivative of CopA unable to bind CopT
stably, was also analyzed. We show here that after initial loop-loop
interaction (kissing), helix propagation resulted in an extended
kissing complex that involves the formation of two intermolecular
helices. By introducing mutations (base-pair inversions) into the
upper stem regions of CopA and CopT, the boundaries of the two newly
formed intermolecular helices were delimited. The resulting extended
kissing complex represents a new type of four-way junction structure
that adopts an asymmetrical X-shaped conformation formed by two helical
domains, each one generated by coaxial stacking of two helices. This
structure motif induces a side-by-side alignment of two long intramolecular
helices that, in turn, facilitates the formation of an additional
intermolecular helix that greatly stabilizes the inhibitory CopA-CopT
RNA complex. This stabilizer helix cannot form in CopI-CopT complexes
due to absence of the sequences involved. The functional significance
of the three-dimensional models of the extended kissing complex (CopI-CopT)

Some rules that govern miRNA/target interaction have been elucidated but their general applicability awaits further experimentation on a case-by-case basis. We use here an assay system in transgenic nematodes to analyze the interaction of the Caenorhabditis elegans lsy-6 miRNA with 3' UTR sequences. In contrast to many previously described assay systems used to analyze miRNA/target interactions, our assay system operates within the cellular context in which lsy-6 normally functions, a single neuron in the nervous system of C. elegans. Through extensive mutational analysis, we define features in the known and experimentally validated target of lsy-6, the 3' UTR of the cog-1 homeobox gene, that are required for a functional miRNA/target interaction. We describe that both in the context of the cog-1 3' UTR and in the context of heterologous 3' UTRs, one or more seed matches are not a reliable predictor for a functional miRNA/target interaction. We rather find that two nonsequence specific contextual features beyond miRNA target sites are critical determinants of miRNA-mediated 3' UTR regulation. The contextual features reside 3' of lsy-6 binding sites in the 3' UTR and act in a combinatorial manner; mutation of each results in limited defects in 3' UTR regulation, but a combinatorial deletion results in complete loss of 3' UTR regulation. Together with two lsy-6 sites, these two contextual features are capable of imparting regulation on a heterologous 3' UTR. Moreover, the contextual features need to be present in a specific configuration relative to miRNA binding sites and could either represent protein binding sites or provide an appropriate structural context. We conclude that a given target site resides in a 3' UTR context that evolved beyond target site complementarity to support regulation by a specific miRNA. The large number of 3' UTRs that we analyzed in this study will also be useful to computational biologists in designing the next generation of miRNA/target prediction algorithms.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells degradation of bulk mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction
requires the consecutive action of the decapping complex (consisting
of DCP1 and DCP2) and the 5' to 3' exonuclease XRN1. These enzymes
are found in discrete cytoplasmic foci known as P-bodies or GW-bodies
(because of the accumulation of the GW182 antigen). Proteins acting
in other post-transcriptional processes have also been localized
to P-bodies. These include SMG5, SMG7, and UPF1, which function in
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), and the Argonaute proteins that
are essential for RNA interference (RNAi) and the micro-RNA (miRNA)
pathway. In addition, XRN1 is required for degradation of mRNAs targeted
by NMD and RNAi. To investigate a possible interplay between P-bodies
and these post-transcriptional processes we depleted P-body or essential
pathway components from Drosophila cells and analyzed the effects
of these depletions on the expression of reporter constructs, allowing
us to monitor specifically NMD, RNAi, or miRNA function. We show
that the RNA-binding protein GW182 and the DCP1:DCP2 decapping complex
are required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing, uncovering a crucial
role for P-body components in the miRNA pathway. Our analysis also
revealed that inhibition of one pathway by depletion of its key effectors
does not prevent the functioning of the other pathways, suggesting
a lack of interdependence in Drosophila.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nt RNA segments that are involved
in the regulation of protein expression primarily by binding to one
or more target sites on an mRNA transcript and inhibiting translation.
MicroRNAs are likely to factor into multiple developmental pathways,
multiple mechanisms of gene regulation, and underlie an array of
inherited disease processes and phenotypic determinants. Several
computational programs exist to predict miRNA targets in mammals,
fruit flies, worms, and plants. However, to date, there is no systematic
collection and description of miRNA targets with experimental support.
We describe a database, TarBase, which houses a manually curated
collection of experimentally tested miRNA targets, in human/mouse,
fruit fly, worm, and zebrafish, distinguishing between those that
tested positive and those that tested negative. Each positive target
site is described by the miRNA that binds it, the gene in which it
occurs, the nature of the experiments that were conducted to test
it, the sufficiency of the site to induce translational repression
and/or cleavage, and the paper from which all these data were extracted.
Additionally, the database is functionally linked to several other
useful databases such as Gene Ontology (GO) and UCSC Genome Browser.
TarBase reveals significantly more experimentally supported targets
than even recent reviews claim, thereby providing a comprehensive
data set from which to assess features of miRNA targeting that will
be useful for the next generation of target prediction programs.

Microarray analysis revealed a high degree of enrichment for miRNA complementary sites in the 3'UTRs of the miRNP-associated mRNAs. mRNAs specifically associated with an individual miRNA were identified by comparing the miRNP-associated mRNAs from wild-type flies and mutant flies lacking miR-1, and their regulation by the miRNA was validated.

of the two major families of snoRNA genes in the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster has been performed using experimental and computational
RNomics methods. Two hundred and twelve gene variants, encoding 56
box H/ACA and 63 box C/D snoRNAs, were identified, of which 57 novel
snoRNAs have been reported for the first time. These snoRNAs were
predicted to guide a total of 147 methylations and pseudouridylations
on rRNAs and snRNAs, showing a more comprehensive pattern of rRNA
modification in the fruit fly. With the exception of nine, all the
snoRNAs identified to date in D. melanogaster are intron encoded.
Remarkably, the genomic organization of the snoRNAs is characteristic
of 8 dUhg genes and 17 intronic gene clusters, demonstrating that
distinct organizations dominate the expression of the two families
of snoRNAs in the fruit fly. Of the 267 introns in the host genes,
more than half have been identified as host introns for coding of
snoRNAs. In contrast to mammals, the variation in size of the host
introns is mainly due to differences in the number of snoRNAs they

research of other noncoding RNA genes in the large introns of the

In animals, miRNAs form imperfect interactions with sequences in the 3' Untranslated region (3'UTR) of mRNAs, causing translational inhibition and mRNA decay. In contrast, plant miRNAs mostly associate with protein coding regions. Here we show that human miR-148 represses DNA methyltransferase 3b (Dnmt3b) gene expression through a region in its coding sequence. This region is evolutionary conserved and present in the Dnmt3b splice variants Dnmt3b1, Dnmt3b2, and Dnmt3b4, but not in the abundantly expressed Dnmt3b3. Whereas overexpression of miR-148 results in decreased DNMT3b1 expression, short-hairpin RNA-mediated miR-148 repression leads to an increase in DNMT3b1 expression. Interestingly, mutating the putative miR-148 target site in Dnmt3b1 abolishes regulation by miR-148. Moreover, endogenous Dnmt3b3 mRNA, which lacks the putative miR-148 target site, is resistant to miR-148-mediated regulation. Thus, our results demonstrate that the coding sequence of Dnmt3b mediates regulation by the miR-148 family. More generally, we provide evidence that coding regions of human genes can be targeted by miRNAs, and that such a mechanism might play a role in determining the relative abundance of different splice variants.},

RNAs (siRNAs) to determine the biochemical properties required for

recognition of siRNAs and catalytic ribonuclease activity of RNA-induced
silencing complexes (RISCs) does not involve the 2'-OH of guide antisense
RNA. In addition, 2' modifications predicted to stabilize siRNA increased
the persistence of RNAi as compared with wild-type siRNAs. RNAi was
also induced with chemical modifications that stabilized interactions
between A-U base pairs, demonstrating that these types of modifications
may enhance mRNA targeting efficiency in allele-specific RNAi. Modifications
altering the structure of the A-form major groove of antisense siRNA-mRNA
duplexes abolished RNAi, suggesting that the major groove of these
duplexes was required for recognition by activated RISC*. Comparative
analysis of the stability and RNAi activities of chemically modified
single-stranded antisense RNA and duplex siRNA suggested that some
catalytic mechanism(s) other than siRNA stability were linked to
RNAi efficiency. Modified or mismatched ribonucleotides incorporated
at internal positions in the 5' or 3' half of the siRNA duplex, as
defined by the antisense strand, indicated that the integrity of
the 5' and not the 3' half of the siRNA structure was important for

the expression of target genes by binding to the target mRNAs. Although
a large number of animal miRNAs has been defined, only a few targets

perfectly to their targets, animal miRNAs bind less tightly, with
a few nucleotides being unbound, thus producing more complex secondary
structures of miRNA/target duplexes. Here, we present a program,
RNA-hybrid, that predicts multiple potential binding sites of miRNAs
in large target RNAs. In general, the program finds the energetically
most favorable hybridization sites of a small RNA in a large RNA.
Intramolecular hybridizations, that is, base pairings between target
nucleotides or between miRNA nucleotides are not allowed. For large
targets, the time complexity of the algorithm is linear in the target
length, allowing many long targets to be searched in a short time.
Statistical significance of predicted targets is assessed with an
extreme value statistics of length normalized minimum free energies,
a Poisson approximation of multiple binding sites, and the calculation
of effective numbers of orthologous targets in comparative studies
of multiple organisms. We applied our method to the prediction of

abstract = {Meiotic maturation in mammalian oocytes is a complex process which involves extensive rearrangement of microtubules, actin filaments and chromosomes. Since cytoskeletal elements are sensitive to disruption by heat shock, a series of experiments were performed to determine whether physiologically relevant heat shock disrupts the progression of the oocyte through meiosis, fertilization and zygote formation. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were cultured at 38.5, 40.0 or 41.0 degrees C for the first 12 h of maturation. Incubation during the last 10 h of maturation and 18 h after fertilization was at 38.5 degrees C and in 5{\%} (v/v) CO2 for both treatments. Examination of the cytoskeleton and the chromosome organization in matured oocytes revealed that oocytes matured at 38.5 degrees C were mostly at metaphase II (MII) stage, while the majority of heat-shocked oocytes were blocked at the first metaphase (MI), first anaphase or first telophase stages. A subset of heat-shocked oocytes possessed misshapen MI spindles with disorganized microtubules and unaligned chromosomes. A higher percentage of TUNEL-positive oocytes was noted for oocytes matured at 41.0 degrees C. Addition of 50 nmol/l sphingosine 1-phosphate to maturation medium blocked the effect of heat shock on progression through meiosis and apoptosis and increased the proportion of oocytes matured at 41.0 degrees C that were at MII. Following insemination, a high percentage of heat-shocked oocytes were unfertilized, while the majority of the control zygotes were fertilized and had two visible pronuclei. In conclusion, heat shock disrupts nuclear maturation and induces apoptosis. These alterations are likely to be involved in the mechanism underlying heat-shock-induced disruption of oocyte capacity for fertilization and subsequent development.},

abstract = {The ambition of systems biology to understand complex biological systems at the molecular level implies that we need to have a concrete and correct understanding of each molecular entity and its function. However, even for the best-studied organism, Escherichia coli, a large number of proteins have never been identified and characterised from wild-type cells, and/or await unravelling of their biological role. Instead, the ORF models for these proteins have been predicted by suitable algorithms and/or through comparison with known, homologous proteins from other organisms, approaches which may be prone to error. In the present study, we used a combination of 2-DE, MALDI-TOF-MS and PMF to identify 1151 different proteins in E. coli K12 JM109. Comparison of the experimental with the theoretical Mr and pI values (4000 experimental values each) allowed the identification of numerous proteins with incorrect or incomplete ORF annotations in the current E. coli genome databases. Several inconsistencies in genome annotation were verified experimentally, and up to 55 candidates await further investigation. Our findings demonstrate how an up-to-date 2-D gel-based proteomics approach can be used for improving the annotation of prokaryotic genomes. They also highlight the need for harmonization among the different E. coli genome databases.},

abstract = {Genetic circuits that regulate distinct cellular processes can differ in their wiring pattern of interactions (architecture) and susceptibility to stochastic fluctuations (noise). Whether the link between circuit architecture and noise is of biological importance remains, however, poorly understood. To investigate this problem, we performed a computational study of gene expression noise for all possible circuit architectures of feed-forward loop (FFL) motifs. Results revealed that FFL architectures fall into two categories depending on whether their ON (stimulated) or OFF (unstimulated) steady states exhibit noise. To explore the biological importance of this difference in noise behavior, we analyzed 858 documented FFLs in Escherichia coli that were divided into 39 functional categories. The majority of FFLs were found to regulate two subsets of functional categories. Interestingly, these two functional categories associated with FFLs of opposite noise behaviors. This opposite noise preference revealed two noise-based strategies to cope with environmental constraints where cellular responses are either initiated or terminated stochastically to allow probabilistic sampling of alternative states. FFLs may thus be selected for their architecture-dependent noise behavior, revealing a biological role for noise that is encoded in gene circuit architectures.},

Here, we describe a high-throughput method to identify intramolecular and intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions experimentally by cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH). As validation, we identified 39 known target sites for box C/D modification-guide small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) on the yeast pre-rRNA. Novel snoRNA-rRNA hybrids were recovered between snR4-5S and U14-25S. These are supported by native electrophoresis and consistent with previously unexplained data. The U3 snoRNA was found to be associated with sequences close to the 3' side of the central pseudoknot in 18S rRNA, supporting a role in formation of this structure. Applying CLASH to the yeast U2 spliceosomal snRNA led to a revised predicted secondary structure, featuring alternative folding of the 3' domain and long-range contacts between the 3' and 5' domains. CLASH should allow transcriptome-wide analyses of RNA-RNA interactions in many organisms.},

abstract = {Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) has long been known to be activated by viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as part of the mammalian immune response. However, in mice PKR is also activated by metabolic stress in the absence of viral infection, and this requires a functional kinase domain, as well as a functional dsRNA-binding domain. The endogenous cellular RNA that potentially leads to PKR activation during metabolic stress is unknown. We investigated this question using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells expressing wild-type PKR (PKRWT) or PKR with a point mutation in each dsRNA-binding motif (PKRRM). Using this system, we identified endogenous RNA that interacts with PKR after induction of metabolic stress by palmitic acid (PA) treatment. Specifically, RIP-Seq analyses showed that the majority of enriched RNAs that interacted with WT PKR (≥twofold, false discovery rate ≤ 5{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) were small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Immunoprecipitation of PKR in extracts of UV-cross-linked cells, followed by RT-qPCR, confirmed that snoRNAs were enriched in PKRWT samples after PA treatment, but not in the PKRRM samples. We also demonstrated that a subset of identified snoRNAs bind and activate PKR in vitro; the presence of a 5'-triphosphate enhanced PKR activity compared with the activity with a 5'-monophosphate, for some, but not all, snoRNAs. Finally, we demonstrated PKR activation in cells upon snoRNA transfection, supporting our hypothesis that endogenous snoRNAs can activate PKR. Our results suggest an unprecedented and unexpected model whereby snoRNAs play a role in the activation of PKR under metabolic stress.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is a potent regulator of gene expression that vastly increases proteomic diversity in multicellular eukaryotes and is associated with organismal complexity. Although alternative splicing is widespread in vertebrates, little is known about the evolutionary origins of this process, in part because of the absence of phylogenetically conserved events that cross major eukaryotic clades. Here we describe a lariat-sequencing approach, which offers high sensitivity for detecting splicing events, and its application to the unicellular fungus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an organism that shares many of the hallmarks of alternative splicing in mammalian systems but for which no previous examples of exon-skipping had been demonstrated. Over 200 previously unannotated splicing events were identified, including examples of regulated alternative splicing. Remarkably, an evolutionary analysis of four of the exons identified here as subject to skipping in S. pombe reveals high sequence conservation and perfect length conservation with their homologs in scores of plants, animals, and fungi. Moreover, alternative splicing of two of these exons have been documented in multiple vertebrate organisms, making these the first demonstrations of identical alternative-splicing patterns in species that are separated by over 1 billion y of evolution.},

Northern analysis of box C/D RNAs reveals two prominent RNA species of different electrophoretic mobilities in total P. furiosus RNA preparations. Together, the results of Northern, ribozyme, RT-PCR, and lariat debranching analyses indicate that the two species are circular and linear RNAs of similar length and abundance. It seems that most, if not all, species of box C/D RNAs exist as circles in P. furiosus. In addition, the circular RNAs are found in complexes with proteins required for box C/D RNA function. Our finding places box C/D RNAs among the extremely few circular RNAs known to exist in nature. Moreover, the unexpected discovery of circular box C/D RNAs points to the existence of a previously unrecognized biogenesis pathway for box C/D RNAs in archaea.},

abstract = {Microbial pathogens with the ability to establish chronic infections have evolved strategies to actively modulate the host immune response. Brucellosis is a disease caused by a Gram-negative intracellular pathogen that if not treated during the initial phase of the infection becomes chronic as the bacteria persist for the lifespan of the host. How this pathogen and others achieve this action is a largely unanswered question. We report here the identification of a Brucella abortus gene (prpA) directly involved in the immune modulation of the host. PrpA belongs to the proline-racemase family and elicits a B lymphocyte polyclonal activation that depends on the integrity of its proline-racemase catalytic site. Stimulation of splenocytes with PrpA also results in IL-10 secretion. Construction of a B. abortus-prpA mutant allowed us to assess the contribution of PrpA to the infection process. Mice infected with B. abortus induced an early and transient nonresponsive status of splenocytes to both Escherichia coli LPS and ConA. This phenomenon was not observed when mice were infected with a B. abortus-prpA mutant. Moreover, the B. abortus-prpA mutant had a reduced capacity to establish a chronic infection in mice. We propose that an early and transient nonresponsive immune condition of the host mediated by this B cell polyclonal activator is required for establishing a successful chronic infection by Brucella.},

Riboswitches are relatively simple, small-molecule-dependent, protein-free, mRNA genetic switches that are attractive targets for reengineering in this context. Using a combination of chemical genetics and genetic selection, we have developed riboswitches that are selective for synthetic "nonnatural" small molecules and no longer respond to the natural intracellular ligands. The orthogonal selectivity of the riboswitches is also demonstrated in vitro using isothermal titration calorimetry and x-ray crystallography. The riboswitches allow highly responsive, dose-dependent, orthogonally selective, and dynamic control of gene expression in vivo. It is possible that this approach may be further developed to reengineer other natural riboswitches for application as small-molecule responsive genetic switches in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

Here, we used RNA-seq to comprehensively and quantitatively assess the transcriptional response of the bacterial opportunistic cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen and endemic soil dweller, Burkholderia cenocepacia, in conditions mimicking these 2 environments. By sequencing 762 million bases of cDNA from 2 closely related B. cenocepacia strains (one isolated from a CF patient and one from soil), we identified a number of potential virulence factors expressed under CF-like conditions, whereas genes whose protein products are involved in nitrogen scavenging and 2-component sensing were among those induced under soil-like conditions. Interestingly, 13 new putative noncoding RNAs were discovered using this technique, 12 of which are preferentially induced in the soil environment, suggesting that ncRNAs play an important role in survival in the soil. In addition, we detected a surprisingly large number of regulatory differences between the 2 strains, which may represent specific adaptations to the niches from which each strain was isolated, despite their high degree of DNA sequence similarity. Compared with the CF strain, the soil strain shows a stronger global gene expression response to its environment, which is consistent with the need for a more dynamic reaction to the heterogeneous conditions of soil.},

The approach, which combines comparative sequence analysis and structure prediction, already has yielded excellent results for a small number of aligned sequences and is suitable for large-scale genomic screens. It consists of two basic components: (i) a measure for RNA secondary structure conservation based on computing a consensus secondary structure, and (ii) a measure for thermodynamic stability, which, in the spirit of a z score, is normalized with respect to both sequence length and base composition but can be calculated without sampling from shuffled sequences. Functional RNA secondary structures can be identified in multiple sequence alignments with high sensitivity and high specificity. We demonstrate that this approach is not only much more accurate than previous methods but also significantly faster. The method is implemented in the program rnaz, which can be downloaded from www.tbi.univie.ac.at/{\~{}}wash/RNAz. We screened all alignments of length n {\textgreater} or = 50 in the Comparative Regulatory Genomics database, which compiles conserved noncoding elements in upstream regions of orthologous genes from human, mouse, rat, Fugu, and zebrafish.

abstract = {SgrS is a 227-nt small RNA that is expressed in Escherichia coli during glucose-phosphate stress, a condition associated with intracellular accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate caused by disruption of glycolytic flux. Under stress conditions, SgrS negatively regulates translation and stability of the ptsG mRNA, encoding the major glucose transporter, by means of a base pairing-dependent mechanism requiring the RNA chaperone Hfq. SgrS activity mitigates the effects of glucose-phosphate stress, and the present study has elucidated a function of SgrS that is proposed to contribute to the stress response. The 5' end of SgrS, upstream of the nucleotides involved in base pairing with the ptsG mRNA, contains a 43-aa ORF, sgrT, that is conserved in most species that contain SgrS-like small RNAs. The sgrT gene is translated in E. coli under conditions of glucose-phosphate stress. Analysis of alleles that separate the base pairing function of SgrS from the sgrT coding sequence revealed that either of these functions alone are sufficient for previously characterized SgrS phenotypes. SgrS-dependent down-regulation of ptsG mRNA stability does not require SgrT and SgrT by itself has no effect on ptsG mRNA stability. Cells expressing sgrT alone had a defect in glucose uptake even though they had nearly wild-type levels of PtsG (IICB(Glc)). Together, these data suggest that SgrS represents a previously unrecognized paradigm for small RNA (sRNA) regulators as a bifunctional RNA that encodes physiologically redundant but mechanistically distinct functions contributing to the same stress response.},

In mice, all four snoRNAs (MBII-13, MBII-52, MBII-85, and MBI-36) are exclusively expressed in the brain, unlike all other known snoRNAs. Two of the human RNA orthologues (HBII-52 and HBI-36) share this expression pattern, and the remainder, HBII-13 and HBII-85, are prevalently expressed in that tissue. In mice and humans, the brain-specific H/ACA box snoRNA (MBI-36 and HBI-36, respectively) is intron-encoded in the brain-specific serotonin 2C receptor gene. The three human C/D box snoRNAs map to chromosome 15q11-q13, within a region implicated in the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), which is a neurogenetic disease resulting from a deficiency of paternal gene expression. Unlike other C/D box snoRNAs, two snoRNAs, HBII-52 and HBII-85, are encoded in a tandemly repeated array of 47 or 24 units, respectively. In mouse the homologue of HBII-52 is processed from intronic portions of the tandem repeats. Interestingly, these snoRNAs were absent from the cortex of a patient with PWS and from a PWS mouse model, demonstrating their paternal imprinting status and pointing to their potential role in the etiology of PWS. Despite displaying hallmarks of the two families of ubiquitous snoRNAs that guide 2'-O-ribose methylation and pseudouridylation of rRNA, respectively, they lack any telltale rRNA complementarity. Instead, brain-specific C/D box snoRNA HBII-52 has an 18-nt phylogenetically conserved complementarity to a critical segment of serotonin 2C receptor mRNA, pointing to a potential role in the processing of this mRNA.},

We have performed a large-scale analysis of transcription start sites, polyadenylation signals, CpG islands, EST data, transcription factor-binding sites, and expression ditag data surrounding intergenic miRNAs in the human genome to improve our understanding of the structure of their primary transcripts. We show that a significant fraction of primary transcripts of intergenic miRNAs are 3-4 kb in length, with clearly defined 5' and 3' boundaries.

The RyhB 90-nt RNA down-regulates a set of iron-storage and iron-using proteins when iron is limiting; it is itself negatively regulated by the ferric uptake repressor protein, Fur (Ferric uptake regulator). RyhB RNA levels are inversely correlated with mRNA levels for the sdhCDAB operon, encoding succinate dehydrogenase, as well as five other genes previously shown to be positively regulated by Fur by an unknown mechanism. These include two other genes encoding enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, acnA and fumA, two ferritin genes, ftnA and bfr, and a gene for superoxide dismutase, sodB. Fur positive regulation of all these genes is fully reversed in an ryhB mutant. Our results explain the previously observed inability of fur mutants to grow on succinate. RyhB requires the RNA-binding protein, Hfq, for activity. Sequences within RyhB are complementary to regions within each of the target genes, suggesting that RyhB acts as an antisense RNA. In sdhCDAB, the complementary region is at the end of the first gene of the sdhCDAB operon; full-length sdhCDAB message disappears and a truncated message, equivalent in size to the region upstream of the complementarity, is detected when RyhB is expressed. RyhB provides a mechanism for the cell to down-regulate iron-storage proteins and nonessential iron-containing proteins when iron is limiting, thus modulating intracellular iron usage to supplement mechanisms for iron uptake directly regulated by Fur.},

Furthermore, neuronal activity inhibited translation of p250GAP, a miR132 target, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of p250GAP mimicked miR132-induced dendrite growth.

the expression of two additional genes, TP53 (p53) and CDKN1A (p21),
which are considered functionally unrelated to menin but are sensitive
markers of cell state. MEN1 RNA and corresponding protein levels
were all reduced after siRNA transfection of HeLa cells, although
the degree of inhibition mediated by individual siRNAs varied. Unexpectedly,
we observed dramatic and significant changes in protein levels of
p53 and p21 that were unrelated to silencing of the target gene.
The modulations in p53 and p21 levels were not abolished on titration
of the siRNAs, and similar results were obtained in three other cell
lines; in none of the cell lines tested did we see an effect on the
protein levels of actin. These data suggest that siRNAs can induce
nonspecific effects on protein levels that are siRNA sequence dependent
but that these effects may be difficult to detect until genes central

AGO2, termed Slicer, directs siRNA- and miRNA-mediated cleavage of

RNA-silencing pathways. Here, we show that AGO1 selectively recruits
certain classes of short silencing-related RNA. AGO1 is physically
associated with miRNAs, transacting siRNAs, and transgene-derived
siRNAs but excludes virus-derived siRNAs and 24-nt siRNAs involved
in chromatin silencing. We also show that AGO1 has Slicer activity.
It mediates the in vitro cleavage of a mir165 target RNA in a manner
that depends on the sequence identity of amino acid residues in the
PIWI domain that are predicted by homology with animal Slicer-competent
AGO proteins to constitute the RNase catalytic center. However, unlike
animals, we find no evidence that AGO1 Slicer is in a high molecular
weight RNA-induced silencing complex. The Slicer activity fractionates
as a complex of approximately 150 kDa that likely constitutes the

we demonstrated that snoRNA genes can be silenced in three trypanosomatid

In T. brucei, silencing was achieved by using the inducible synthesis
of double-stranded RNA from T7 opposing promoters. Silencing varied
between the different snoRNA genes, which may reflect the accessibility
of small interfering RNA to the target RNAs. This study suggests
that RNA interference can degrade snoRNAs. This study has further

In animals, miRNAs regulate genes by attenuating protein translation
through imperfect base pair binding to 3' UTR sequences of target
genes. A major challenge in understanding the regulatory role of
miRNAs is to accurately predict regulated targets. We have developed
an algorithm for predicting targets that does not rely on evolutionary
conservation. As one of the features of this algorithm, we incorporate
the folded structure of mRNA. By using Drosophila miRNAs as a test
case, we have validated our predictions in 10 of 15 genes tested.
One of these validated genes is mad as a target for bantam. Furthermore,
our computational and experimental data suggest that miRNAs have
fewer targets than previously reported.},

via specific RNA:RNA base pairing interactions at the hns locus to
antagonize H-NS translation. We also give evidence that supports
a role for RNA:RNA interactions at the rpoS locus to enhance RpoS
translation. Negative regulation of hns by DsrA is achieved by the
RNA:RNA interaction blocking translation of hns RNA. In contrast,
results suggest that positive regulation of rpoS by DsrA occurs by
formation of an RNA structure that activates a cis-acting translational
operator. Sequences within DsrA complementary to three additional
genes, argR, ilvIH, and rbsD, suggest that DsrA is a riboregulator
of gene expression that acts coordinately via RNA:RNA interactions

it forms a stable, homodimeric kissing complex through only two intermolecular

adenines adjacent to the intermolecular G small middle dotC base
pairs, plus unusual strong electrostatic interactions around the

DsrA has opposite effects on these transcriptional regulators. H-NS levels decrease, whereas RpoS (final sigma(s)) levels increase. Here we show that DsrA enhances hns mRNA turnover yet stabilizes rpoS mRNA, either directly or via effects on translation. Computational and RNA footprinting approaches led to a refined structure for DsrA, and a model in which DsrA interacts with the hns mRNA start and stop codon regions to form a coaxial stack. Analogous bipartite interactions exist in eukaryotes, albeit with different regulatory consequences. In contrast, DsrA base pairs in discrete fashion with the rpoS RNA translational operator. Thus, different structural configurations for DsrA lead to opposite regulatory consequences for target RNAs.},

abstract = {DsrA RNA regulates both transcription, by overcoming transcriptional
silencing by the nucleoid-associated H-NS protein, and translation,
by promoting efficient translation of the stress sigma factor, RpoS.
These two activities of DsrA can be separated by mutation: the first
of three stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide RNA is necessary for RpoS
translation but not for anti-H-NS action, while the second stem-loop
is essential for antisilencing and less critical for RpoS translation.
The third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator,
can be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss
of either DsrA function. The sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA
is complementary with the upstream leader portion of rpoS messenger
RNA, suggesting that pairing of DsrA with the rpoS message might
be important for translational regulation. Mutations in the Rpos
leader and compensating mutations in DsrA confirm that this predicted
pairing is necessary for DsrA stimulation of RpoS translation. We
propose that DsrA pairing stimulates RpoS translation by acting as
an anti-antisense RNA, freeing the translation initiation region
from the cis-acting antisense RNA and allowing increased translation.},

Functional miRNA-binding sites in the coding regions or 5' UTRs of endogenous mRNAs have not been identified. We studied the effect of introducing miRNA target sites into the 5' UTR of luciferase reporter mRNAs containing internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), so that potential steric hindrance by a microribonucleoprotein complex would not interfere with the initiation of translation. In human HeLa cells, which express endogenous let-7a miRNA, the translational efficiency of these IRES-containing reporters with 5' let-7 complementary sites from the Caenorhabditis elegans lin-41 3' UTR was repressed. Similarly, the IRES-containing reporters were translationally repressed when human Ago2 was tethered to either the 5' or 3' UTR. Interestingly, the method of DNA transfection affected our ability to observe miRNA-mediated repression. Our results suggest that association with any position on a target mRNA is mechanistically sufficient for a microribonucleoprotein to exert repression of translation at some step downstream of initiation.},

The time complexity of our algorithm is O(|F(1)| |F(2) deg(F(1)) deg(F(2)) (deg(F(1)) + deg(F(2))) where |F(i)| is the number of nodes in forest F(i) and deg (F(i)) is the degree of F(i).

We suggest a new representation of RNA secondary structures as forests that allow reasonable scoring of edit operations on RNA secondary structures. The comparison of RNA secondary structures is facilitated by a new visualization technique for RNA secondary structure alignments.

One way fungi accomplish this feat and overcome intercellular toxin accumulation is efflux pumps, in particular ATP-binding cassette transporters and transporters of the major facilitator superfamily. Members of these two superfamilies remove many toxic compounds by coupling transport with ATP hydrolysis or a proton gradient, respectively. Fungal genomes encode a plethora of members of these families of transporters compared to other organisms. In this review we discuss the role these two fungal superfamilies of transporters play in virulence and resistance to antifungal agents. These efflux transporters are responsible not only for export of compounds involved in pathogenesis such as secondary metabolites, but also export of host-derived antimicrobial compounds. In addition, we examine the current knowledge of these transporters in resistance of pathogens to clinically relevant antifungal agents.},

We isolated mutants defective in growth under hypoxic conditions, but normal for growth in normoxic conditions, in Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis. Two regulatory pathways were identified: one homologous to the mammalian sterol-response element binding protein (SREBP) cholesterol biosynthesis regulatory pathway, and the other a two-component-like pathway involving a fungal-specific hybrid histidine kinase family member, Tco1. We show that cleavage of the SREBP precursor homolog Sre1-which is predicted to release its DNA-binding domain from the membrane-occurs in response to hypoxia, and that Sre1 is required for hypoxic induction of genes encoding for oxygen-dependent enzymes involved in ergosterol synthesis. Importantly, mutants in either the SREBP pathway or the Tco1 pathway display defects in their ability to proliferate in host tissues and to cause disease in infected mice, linking for the first time to our knowledge hypoxic adaptation and pathogenesis by a eukaryotic aerobe. SREBP pathway mutants were found to be a hundred times more sensitive than wild-type to fluconazole, a widely used antifungal agent that inhibits ergosterol synthesis, suggesting that inhibitors of SREBP processing could substantially enhance the potency of current therapies.},

abstract = {An Argonaute homolog and a functional Dicer have been identified in the ancient eukaryote Giardia lamblia, which apparently lacks the ability to perform RNA interference (RNAi). The Giardia Argonaute plays an essential role in growth and is capable of binding specifically to the m(7)G-cap, suggesting a potential involvement in microRNA (miRNA)-mediated translational repression. To test such a possibility, small RNAs were isolated from Giardia trophozoites, cloned, and sequenced. A 26-nucleotide (nt) small RNA (miR2) was identified as a product of Dicer-processed snoRNA GlsR17 and localized to the cytoplasm by fluorescence in situ hybridization, whereas GlsR17 was found primarily in the nucleolus of only one of the two nuclei in Giardia. Three other small RNAs were also identified as products of snoRNAs, suggesting that the latter could be novel precursors of miRNAs in Giardia. Putative miR2 target sites were identified at the 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) of 22 variant surface protein mRNAs using the miRanda program. In vivo expression of Renilla luciferase mRNA containing six identical miR2 target sites in the 3'-UTR was reduced by 40{\%} when co-transfected with synthetic miR2, while the level of luciferase mRNA remained unaffected. Thus, miR2 likely affects translation but not mRNA stability. This repression, however, was not observed when Argonaute was knocked down in Giardia using a ribozyme-antisense RNA. Instead, an enhancement of luciferase expression was observed, suggesting a loss of endogenous miR2-mediated repression when this protein is depleted. Additionally, the level of miR2 was significantly reduced when Dicer was knocked down. In all, the evidence indicates the presence of a snoRNA-derived miRNA-mediated translational repression in Giardia.},

Thanks in part to its thick and strongly melanized cell walls, E. dermatitidis is extremely tolerant to various kinds of stress, including extreme pH, temperature and desiccation. E. dermatitidis is also the agent responsible for various severe illnesses in humans, such as pneumonia and keratitis, and might lead to fatal brain infections. Due to its association with the human environment, its poly-extremophilic lifestyle and its pathogenicity in humans, E. dermatitidis has become an important model organism. In this study we present the functional analysis of the transcriptional response of the fungus at 1°C and 45°C, in comparison with that at 37°C, for two different exposition times, i.e. 1 hour and 1 week. At 1°C, E. dermatitidis uses a large repertoire of tools to acclimatize, such as lipid membrane fluidization, trehalose production or cytoskeleton rearrangement, which allows the fungus to remain metabolically active. At 45°C, the fungus drifts into a replicative state and increases the activity of the Golgi apparatus. As a novel finding, our study provides evidence that, apart from the protein coding genes, non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs as well as fusion-transcripts are differentially regulated and that the function of the fusion-transcripts can be related to the corresponding temperature condition. This work establishes that E. dermatitidis adapts to its environment by modulating coding and non-coding gene transcription levels and through the regulation of chimeric and circular RNAs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Melanin pigments are ubiquitous in nature. Melanized microorganisms are often the dominating species in certain extreme environments, such as soils contaminated with radionuclides, suggesting that the presence of melanin is beneficial in their life cycle. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation could change the electronic properties of melanin and might enhance the growth of melanized microorganisms.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ionizing irradiation changed the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal of melanin, consistent with changes in electronic structure. Irradiated melanin manifested a 4-fold increase in its capacity to reduce NADH relative to non-irradiated melanin. HPLC analysis of melanin from fungi grown on different substrates revealed chemical complexity, dependence of melanin composition on the growth substrate and possible influence of melanin composition on its interaction with ionizing radiation. XTT/MTT assays showed increased metabolic activity of melanized C. neoformans cells relative to non-melanized cells, and exposure to ionizing radiation enhanced the electron-transfer properties of melanin in melanized cells. Melanized Wangiella dermatitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans cells exposed to ionizing radiation approximately 500 times higher than background grew significantly faster as indicated by higher CFUs, more dry weight biomass and 3-fold greater incorporation of (14)C-acetate than non-irradiated melanized cells or irradiated albino mutants. In addition, radiation enhanced the growth of melanized Cladosporium sphaerospermum cells under limited nutrients conditions.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Exposure of melanin to ionizing radiation, and possibly other forms of electromagnetic radiation, changes its electronic properties. Melanized fungal cells manifested increased growth relative to non-melanized cells after exposure to ionizing radiation, raising intriguing questions about a potential role for melanin in energy capture and utilization.},

abstract = {The repertoire of microeukaryotes in the human gut has been poorly explored, mainly in individuals living in northern hemisphere countries. We further explored this repertoire using PCR-sequencing and culture in seven individuals living in four tropical countries. A total of 41 microeukaryotes including 38 different fungal species and three protists were detected. Four fungal species, Davidiella tassiana, Davidiella sp., Corticiaceae sp., and Penicillium sp., were uniquely detected by culture; 27 fungal species were uniquely detected using PCR-sequencing and Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Trichosporon asahii, Clavispora lusitaniae, Debaryomyces hansenii, Malassezia restricta, and Malassezia sp. were detected using both molecular and culture methods. Fourteen microeukaryotes were shared by the seven individuals, whereas 27 species were found in only one individual, including 11 species in Amazonia, nine species in Polynesia, five species in India, and two species in Senegal. These data support a worldwide distribution of Malassezia sp., Trichosporon sp., and Candida sp. in the gut mycobiome. Here, 13 fungal species and two protists, Stentor roeseli and Vorticella campanula, were observed for first time in the human gut. This study revealed a previously unsuspected diversity in the repertoire of human gut microeukaryotes, suggesting spots for further exploring this repertoire.},

abstract = {The number of fully sequenced fungal genomes is rapidly increasing. Since genetic tools are poorly developed for most filamentous fungi, it is currently difficult to employ genetic engineering for understanding the biology of these fungi and to fully exploit them industrially. For that reason there is a demand for developing versatile methods that can be used to genetically manipulate non-model filamentous fungi. To facilitate this, we have developed a CRISPR-Cas9 based system adapted for use in filamentous fungi. The system is simple and versatile, as RNA guided mutagenesis can be achieved by transforming a target fungus with a single plasmid. The system currently contains four CRISPR-Cas9 vectors, which are equipped with commonly used fungal markers allowing for selection in a broad range of fungi. Moreover, we have developed a script that allows identification of protospacers that target gene homologs in multiple species to facilitate introduction of common mutations in different filamentous fungi. With these tools we have performed RNA-guided mutagenesis in six species of which one has not previously been genetically engineered. Moreover, for a wild-type Aspergillus aculeatus strain, we have used our CRISPR Cas9 system to generate a strain that contains an AACU{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}pyrG marker and demonstrated that the resulting strain can be used for iterative gene targeting.},

abstract = {Observations of enhanced growth of melanized fungi under low-dose ionizing radiation in the laboratory and in the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor suggest they have adapted the ability to survive or even benefit from exposure to ionizing radiation. However, the cellular and molecular mechanism of fungal responses to such radiation remains poorly understood. Using the black yeast Wangiella dermatitidis as a model, we confirmed that ionizing radiation enhanced cell growth by increasing cell division and cell size. Using RNA-seq technology, we compared the transcriptomic profiles of the wild type and the melanin-deficient wdpks1 mutant under irradiation and non-irradiation conditions. It was found that more than 3000 genes were differentially expressed when these two strains were constantly exposed to a low dose of ionizing radiation and that half were regulated at least two fold in either direction. Functional analysis indicated that many genes for amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and cell cycle progression were down-regulated and that a number of antioxidant genes and genes affecting membrane fluidity were up-regulated in both irradiated strains. However, the expression of ribosomal biogenesis genes was significantly up-regulated in the irradiated wild-type strain but not in the irradiated wdpks1 mutant, implying that melanin might help to contribute radiation energy for protein translation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that long-term exposure to low doses of radiation significantly increased survivability of both the wild-type and the wdpks1 mutant, which was correlated with reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased production of carotenoid and induced expression of genes encoding translesion DNA synthesis. Our results represent the first functional genomic study of how melanized fungal cells respond to low dose ionizing radiation and provide clues for the identification of biological processes, molecular pathways and individual genes regulated by radiation.},

The most frequent opportunistic pathogenic species were Exophiala dermatitidis, Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto, Exophiala phaeomuriformis, Fusarium dimerum, and the Saprochaete/Magnusiomyces clade. The black yeast E. dermatitidis was detected in 47{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of the dishwashers, primarily at the dishwasher rubber seals, at up to 106 CFU/cm2; the other fungi detected were in the range of 102 to 105 CFU/cm2. The other most heavily contaminated dishwasher sites were side nozzles, doors and drains. Only F. dimerum was isolated from washed dishes, while dishwasher waste water contained E. dermatitidis, Exophiala oligosperma and Sarocladium killiense. Plumbing systems supplying water to household appliances represent the most probable route for contamination of dishwashers, as the fungi that represented the core dishwasher mycobiota were also detected in the tap water. Hot aerosols from dishwashers contained the human opportunistic yeast C. parapsilosis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and E. dermatitidis (as well as common air-borne genera such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma and Cladosporium). Comparison of fungal contamination of kitchens without and with dishwashers revealed that virtually all were contaminated with fungi. In both cases, the most contaminated sites were the kitchen drain and the dish drying rack. The most important difference was higher prevalence of black yeasts (E. dermatitidis in particular) in kitchens with dishwashers. In kitchens without dishwashers, C. parapsilosis strongly prevailed with negligible occurrence of E. dermatitidis. F. dimerum was isolated only from kitchens with dishwashers, while Saprochaete/Magnusiomyces isolates were only found within dishwashers. We conclude that dishwashers represent a reservoir of enriched opportunistic pathogenic species that can spread from the dishwasher into the indoor biome.},

The relatively straightforward, robust, and cost-effective GBS protocol is currently being applied in numerous species by a large number of researchers. Herein we describe a bioinformatics pipeline, TASSEL-GBS, designed for the efficient processing of raw GBS sequence data into SNP genotypes. The TASSEL-GBS pipeline successfully fulfills the following key design criteria: (1) Ability to run on the modest computing resources that are typically available to small breeding or ecological research programs, including desktop or laptop machines with only 8-16 GB of RAM, (2) Scalability from small to extremely large studies, where hundreds of thousands or even millions of SNPs can be scored in up to 100,000 individuals (e.g., for large breeding programs or genetic surveys), and (3) Applicability in an accelerated breeding context, requiring rapid turnover from tissue collection to genotypes. Although a reference genome is required, the pipeline can also be run with an unfinished "pseudo-reference" consisting of numerous contigs. We describe the TASSEL-GBS pipeline in detail and benchmark it based upon a large scale, species wide analysis in maize (Zea mays), where the average error rate was reduced to 0.0042 through application of population genetic-based SNP filters. Overall, the GBS assay and the TASSEL-GBS pipeline provide robust tools for studying genomic diversity.},

abstract = {Azole compounds are the primary therapy for patients with diseases caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. However, prolonged treatment may cause resistance to develop, which is associated with treatment failure. The azole target cyp51A is a hotspot for mutations that confer phenotypic resistance, but in an increasing number of resistant isolates the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report the discovery of a novel resistance mechanism, caused by a mutation in the CCAAT-binding transcription factor complex subunit HapE. From one patient, four A. fumigatus isolates were serially collected. The last two isolates developed an azole resistant phenotype during prolonged azole therapy. Because the resistant isolates contained a wild type cyp51A gene and the isolates were isogenic, the complete genomes of the last susceptible isolate and the first resistant isolate (taken 17 weeks apart) were sequenced using Illumina technology to identify the resistance conferring mutation. By comparing the genome sequences to each other as well as to two A. fumigatus reference genomes, several potential non-synonymous mutations in protein-coding regions were identified, six of which could be confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Subsequent sexual crossing experiments showed that resistant progeny always contained a P88L substitution in HapE, while the presence of the other five mutations did not correlate with resistance in the progeny. Cloning the mutated hapE gene into the azole susceptible akuB(KU80) strain showed that the HapE P88L mutation by itself could confer the resistant phenotype. This is the first time that whole genome sequencing and sexual crossing strategies have been used to find the genetic basis of a trait of interest in A. fumigatus. The discovery may help understand alternate pathways for azole resistance in A. fumigatus with implications for the molecular diagnosis of resistance and drug discovery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are applied worldwide in the production of a variety of fermented food products. Additionally, specific Lactobacillus species are nowadays recognized for their health-promoting effects on the consumer. To optimally exert such beneficial effects, it is considered of great importance that these probiotic bacteria reach their target sites in the gut alive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the accompanying manuscript by Bron et al. the probiotic model organism Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 was cultured under different fermentation conditions, which was complemented by the determination of the corresponding molecular responses by full-genome transcriptome analyses. Here, the gastrointestinal (GI) survival of the cultures produced was assessed in an in vitro assay. Variations in fermentation conditions led to dramatic differences in GI-tract survival (up to 7-log) and high robustness could be associated with low salt and low pH during the fermentations. Moreover, random forest correlation analyses allowed the identification of specific transcripts associated with robustness. Subsequently, the corresponding genes were targeted by genetic engineering, aiming to enhance robustness, which could be achieved for 3 of the genes that negatively correlated with robustness and where deletion derivatives displayed enhanced survival compared to the parental strain. Specifically, a role in GI-tract survival could be confirmed for the lp{\_}1669-encoded AraC-family transcription regulator, involved in capsular polysaccharide remodeling, the penicillin-binding protein Pbp2A involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter NapA3. Moreover, additional physiological analysis established a role for Pbp2A and NapA3 in bile salt and salt tolerance, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Transcriptome trait matching enabled the identification of biomarkers for bacterial (gut-)robustness, which is important for our molecular understanding of GI-tract survival and could facilitate the design of culture conditions aimed to enhance probiotic culture robustness.},

abstract = {RNA-seq is a powerful tool for comprehensive characterization of whole transcriptome at both gene and exon levels and with a unique ability of identifying novel splicing variants. To date, RNA-seq analysis of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been reported. In this study, we performed transcriptome analyses for 10 matched pairs of cancer and non-cancerous tissues from HCC patients on Solexa/Illumina GAII platform. On average, about 21.6 million sequencing reads and 10.6 million aligned reads were obtained for samples sequenced on each lane, which was able to identify {\textgreater}50{\%} of all the annotated genes for each sample. Furthermore, we identified 1,378 significantly differently expressed genes (DEGs) and 24, 338 differentially expressed exons (DEEs). Comprehensive function analyses indicated that cell growth-related, metabolism-related and immune-related pathways were most significantly enriched by DEGs, pointing to a complex mechanism for HCC carcinogenesis. Positional gene enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were most significantly enriched at chromosome 8q21.3-24.3. The most interesting findings were from the analysis at exon levels where we characterized three major patterns of expression changes between gene and exon levels, implying a much complex landscape of transcript-specific differential expressions in HCC. Finally, we identified a novel highly up-regulated exon-exon junction in ATAD2 gene in HCC tissues. Overall, to our best knowledge, our study represents the most comprehensive characterization of HBV-related HCC transcriptome including exon level expression changes and novel splicing variants, which illustrated the power of RNA-seq and provided important clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms of HCC pathogenesis at system-wide levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diverse bacterial genomes encode numerous small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) that regulate myriad biological processes. While bioinformatic algorithms have proven effective in identifying sRNA-encoding loci, the lack of tools and infrastructure with which to execute these computationally demanding algorithms has limited their utilization. Genome-wide predictions of sRNA-encoding genes have been conducted in less than 3{\%} of all sequenced bacterial strains, leading to critical gaps in current annotations. The relative paucity of genome-wide sRNA prediction represents a critical gap in current annotations of bacterial genomes and has limited examination of larger issues in sRNA biology, such as sRNA evolution. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have developed and deployed SIPHT, a high throughput computational tool that utilizes workflow management and distributed computing to effectively conduct kingdom-wide predictions and annotations of intergenic sRNA-encoding genes. Candidate sRNA-encoding loci are identified based on the presence of putative Rho-independent terminators downstream of conserved intergenic sequences, and each locus is annotated for several features, including conservation in other species, association with one of several transcription factor binding sites and homology to any of over 300 previously identified sRNAs and cis-regulatory RNA elements. Using SIPHT, we conducted searches for putative sRNA-encoding genes in all 932 bacterial replicons in the NCBI database. These searches yielded nearly 60{\%} of previously confirmed sRNAs, hundreds of previously annotated cis-encoded regulatory RNA elements such as riboswitches, and over 45,000 novel candidate intergenic loci. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Candidate loci were identified across all branches of the bacterial evolutionary tree, suggesting a central and ubiquitous role for RNA-mediated regulation among bacterial species. Annotation of candidate loci by SIPHT provides clues into the potential biological function of thousands of previously confirmed and candidate regulatory RNAs and affords new insights into the evolution of bacterial riboregulation.},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that the microRNA miR-24 suppresses p16 expression in human diploid fibroblasts and cervical carcinoma cells. Increased p16 expression with replicative senescence was associated with decreased levels of miR-24, a microRNA that was predicted to associate with the p16 mRNA coding and 3'-untranslated regions. Ectopic miR-24 overexpression reduced p16 protein but not p16 mRNA levels. Conversely, introduction of antisense (AS)-miR-24 blocked miR-24 expression and markedly enhanced p16 protein levels, p16 translation, and the production of EGFP-p16 reporter bearing the miR-24 target recognition sites. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, our results suggest that miR-24 represses the initiation and elongation phases of p16 translation.},

abstract = {Hortaea werneckii, ascomycetous yeast from the order Capnodiales, shows an exceptional adaptability to osmotically stressful conditions. To investigate this unusual phenotype we obtained a draft genomic sequence of a H. werneckii strain isolated from hypersaline water of solar saltern. Two of its most striking characteristics that may be associated with a halotolerant lifestyle are the large genetic redundancy and the expansion of genes encoding metal cation transporters. Although no sexual state of H. werneckii has yet been described, a mating locus with characteristics of heterothallic fungi was found. The total assembly size of the genome is 51.6 Mb, larger than most phylogenetically related fungi, coding for almost twice the usual number of predicted genes (23333). The genome appears to have experienced a relatively recent whole genome duplication, and contains two highly identical gene copies of almost every protein. This is consistent with some previous studies that reported increases in genomic DNA content triggered by exposure to salt stress. In hypersaline conditions transmembrane ion transport is of utmost importance. The analysis of predicted metal cation transporters showed that most types of transporters experienced several gene duplications at various points during their evolution. Consequently they are present in much higher numbers than expected. The resulting diversity of transporters presents interesting biotechnological opportunities for improvement of halotolerance of salt-sensitive species. The involvement of plasma P-type H⁺ ATPases in adaptation to different concentrations of salt was indicated by their salt dependent transcription. This was not the case with vacuolar H⁺ ATPases, which were transcribed constitutively. The availability of this genomic sequence is expected to promote the research of H. werneckii. Studying its extreme halotolerance will not only contribute to our understanding of life in hypersaline environments, but should also identify targets for improving the salt- and osmotolerance of economically important plants and microorganisms.},

abstract = {The role of spliceosomal intronic structures played in evolution has only begun to be elucidated. Comparative genomic analyses of fungal snoRNA sequences, which are often contained within introns and/or exons, revealed that about one-third of snoRNA-associated introns in three major snoRNA gene clusters manifested polymorphisms, likely resulting from intron loss and gain events during fungi evolution. Genomic deletions can clearly be observed as one mechanism underlying intron and exon loss, as well as generation of complex introns where several introns lie in juxtaposition without intercalating exons. Strikingly, by tracking conserved snoRNAs in introns, we found that some introns had moved from one position to another by excision from donor sites and insertion into target sties elsewhere in the genome without needing transposon structures. This study revealed the origin of many newly gained introns. Moreover, our analyses suggested that intron-containing sequences were more prone to sustainable structural changes than DNA sequences without introns due to intron's ability to jump within the genome via unknown mechanisms. We propose that splicing-related structural features of introns serve as an additional motor to propel evolution.},

abstract = {Profound understanding of the mechanisms foodborne pathogenic bacteria utilize in adaptation to the environmental stress they encounter during food processing and storage is of paramount importance in design of control measures. Chill temperature is a central control measure applied in minimally processed foods; however, data on the mechanisms the foodborne pathogen Clostridium botulinum activates upon cold stress are scarce. Transcriptomic analysis on the C. botulinum ATCC 3502 strain upon temperature downshift from 37°C to 15°C was performed to identify the cold-responsive gene set of this organism. Significant up- or down-regulation of 16 and 11 genes, respectively, was observed 1 h after the cold shock. At 5 h after the temperature downshift, 199 and 210 genes were up- or down-regulated, respectively. Thus, the relatively small gene set affected initially indicated a targeted acute response to cold shock, whereas extensive metabolic remodeling appeared to take place after prolonged exposure to cold. Genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis, oxidative stress response, and iron uptake and storage were induced, in addition to mechanisms previously characterized as cold-tolerance related in bacteria. Furthermore, several uncharacterized DNA-binding transcriptional regulator-encoding genes were induced, suggesting involvement of novel regulatory mechanisms in the cold shock response of C. botulinum. The role of such regulators, CBO0477 and CBO0558A, in cold tolerance of C. botulinum ATCC 3502 was demonstrated by deteriorated growth of related mutants at 17°C.},

abstract = {Many genomes have been sequenced to high-quality draft status using Sanger capillary electrophoresis and/or newer short-read sequence data and whole genome assembly techniques. However, even the best draft genomes contain gaps and other imperfections due to limitations in the input data and the techniques used to build draft assemblies. Sequencing biases, repetitive genomic features, genomic polymorphism, and other complicating factors all come together to make some regions difficult or impossible to assemble. Traditionally, draft genomes were upgraded to "phase 3 finished" status using time-consuming and expensive Sanger-based manual finishing processes. For more facile assembly and automated finishing of draft genomes, we present here an automated approach to finishing using long-reads from the Pacific Biosciences RS (PacBio) platform. Our algorithm and associated software tool, PBJelly, (publicly available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/pb-jelly/) automates the finishing process using long sequence reads in a reference-guided assembly process. PBJelly also provides "lift-over" co-ordinate tables to easily port existing annotations to the upgraded assembly. Using PBJelly and long PacBio reads, we upgraded the draft genome sequences of a simulated Drosophila melanogaster, the version 2 draft Drosophila pseudoobscura, an assembly of the Assemblathon 2.0 budgerigar dataset, and a preliminary assembly of the Sooty mangabey. With 24× mapped coverage of PacBio long-reads, we addressed 99{\%} of gaps and were able to close 69{\%} and improve 12{\%} of all gaps in D. pseudoobscura. With 4× mapped coverage of PacBio long-reads we saw reads address 63{\%} of gaps in our budgerigar assembly, of which 32{\%} were closed and 63{\%} improved. With 6.8× mapped coverage of mangabey PacBio long-reads we addressed 97{\%} of gaps and closed 66{\%} of addressed gaps and improved 19{\%}. The accuracy of gap closure was validated by comparison to Sanger sequencing on gaps from the original D. pseudoobscura draft assembly and shown to be dependent on initial reference quality.},

abstract = {The bacterial small heat shock protein IbpA protects client proteins from aggregation. Due to redundancy in the cellular chaperone network, deletion of the ibpA gene often leads to only a mild or no phenotypic defect. In this study, we show that a Pseudomonas putida ibpA deletion mutant has a severe growth defect under heat stress conditions and reduced survival during recovery revealing a critical role of IbpA in heat tolerance. Transcription of the ibpA gene depends on the alternative heat shock sigma factor $\sigma$(32). Production of IbpA protein only at heat shock temperatures suggested additional translational control. We conducted a comprehensive structural and functional analysis of the 5' untranslated regions of the ibpA genes from P. putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both contain a ROSE-type RNA thermometer that is substantially shorter and simpler than previously reported ROSE elements. Comprised of two hairpin structures only, they inhibit translation at low temperature and permit translation initiation after a temperature upshift. Both elements regulate reporter gene expression in Escherichia coli and ribosome binding in vitro in a temperature-dependent manner. Structure probing revealed local melting of the second hairpin whereas the first hairpin remained unaffected. High sequence and structure conservation of pseudomonal ibpA untranslated regions and their ability to confer thermoregulation in vivo suggest that short ROSE-like thermometers are commonly used to control IbpA synthesis in Pseudomonas species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein encoding genes have long been the major targets
for research in schizophrenia genetics. However, with the identification
of regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) as important in brain development
and function, miRNAs genes have emerged as candidates for schizophrenia-associated
genetic factors. Indeed, the growing understanding of the regulatory
properties and pleiotropic effects that miRNA have on molecular and
cellular mechanisms, suggests that alterations in the interactions
between miRNAs and their mRNA targets may contribute to phenotypic
variation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have studied the association
between schizophrenia and genetic variants of miRNA genes associated
with brain-expression using a case-control study design on three
Scandinavian samples. Eighteen known SNPs within or near brain-expressed
miRNAs in three samples (Danish, Swedish and Norwegian: 420/163/257
schizophrenia patients and 1006/177/293 control subjects), were analyzed.
Subsequently, joint analysis of the three samples was performed on
SNPs showing marginal association. Two SNPs rs17578796 and rs1700
in hsa-mir-206 (mir-206) and hsa-mit-198 (mir-198) showed nominal
significant allelic association to schizophrenia in the Danish and
Norwegian sample respectively (P = 0.0021 {\&} p = 0.038), of which
only rs17578796 was significant in the joint sample. In-silico analysis
revealed that 8 of the 15 genes predicted to be regulated by both
mir-206 and mir-198, are transcriptional targets or interaction partners
of the JUN, ATF2 and TAF1 connected in a tight network. JUN and two
of the miRNA targets (CCND2 and PTPN1) in the network have previously
been associated with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We
found nominal association between brain-expressed miRNAs and schizophrenia
for rs17578796 and rs1700 located in mir-206 and mir-198 respectively.
These two miRNAs have a surprising large number (15) of targets in
common, eight of which are also connected by the same transcription

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Massively parallel sequencing offers an enormous potential for expression profiling, in particular for interspecific comparisons. Currently, different platforms for massively parallel sequencing are available, which differ in read length and sequencing costs. The 454-technology offers the highest read length. The other sequencing technologies are more cost effective, on the expense of shorter reads. Reliable expression profiling by massively parallel sequencing depends crucially on the accuracy to which the reads could be mapped to the corresponding genes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed an in silico analysis to evaluate whether incorrect mapping of the sequence reads results in a biased expression pattern. A comparison of six available mapping software tools indicated a considerable heterogeneity in mapping speed and accuracy. Independently of the software used to map the reads, we found that for compact genomes both short (35 bp, 50 bp) and long sequence reads (100 bp) result in an almost unbiased expression pattern. In contrast, for species with a larger genome containing more gene families and repetitive DNA, shorter reads (35-50 bp) produced a considerable bias in gene expression. In humans, about 10{\%} of the genes had fewer than 50{\%} of the sequence reads correctly mapped. Sequence polymorphism up to 9{\%} had almost no effect on the mapping accuracy of 100 bp reads. For 35 bp reads up to 3{\%} sequence divergence did not affect the mapping accuracy strongly. The effect of indels on the mapping efficiency strongly depends on the mapping software. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In complex genomes, expression profiling by massively parallel sequencing could introduce a considerable bias due to incorrectly mapped sequence reads if the read length is short. Nevertheless, this bias could be accounted for if the genomic sequence is known. Furthermore, sequence polymorphisms and indels also affect the mapping accuracy and may cause a biased gene expression measurement. The choice of the mapping software is highly critical and the reliability depends on the presence/absence of indels and the divergence between reads and the reference genome. Overall, we found SSAHA2 and CLC to produce the most reliable mapping results.},

abstract = {Three closely related thermally dimorphic pathogens are causal agents of major fungal diseases affecting humans in the Americas: blastomycosis, histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomycosis. Here we report the genome sequence and analysis of four strains of the etiological agent of blastomycosis, Blastomyces, and two species of the related genus Emmonsia, typically pathogens of small mammals. Compared to related species, Blastomyces genomes are highly expanded, with long, often sharply demarcated tracts of low GC-content sequence. These GC-poor isochore-like regions are enriched for gypsy elements, are variable in total size between isolates, and are least expanded in the avirulent B. dermatitidis strain ER-3 as compared with the virulent B. gilchristii strain SLH14081. The lack of similar regions in related species suggests these isochore-like regions originated recently in the ancestor of the Blastomyces lineage. While gene content is highly conserved between Blastomyces and related fungi, we identified changes in copy number of genes potentially involved in host interaction, including proteases and characterized antigens. In addition, we studied gene expression changes of B. dermatitidis during the interaction of the infectious yeast form with macrophages and in a mouse model. Both experiments highlight a strong antioxidant defense response in Blastomyces, and upregulation of dioxygenases in vivo suggests that dioxide produced by antioxidants may be further utilized for amino acid metabolism. We identify a number of functional categories upregulated exclusively in vivo, such as secreted proteins, zinc acquisition proteins, and cysteine and tryptophan metabolism, which may include critical virulence factors missed before in in vitro studies. Across the dimorphic fungi, loss of certain zinc acquisition genes and differences in amino acid metabolism suggest unique adaptations of Blastomyces to its host environment. These results reveal the dynamics of genome evolution and of factors contributing to virulence in Blastomyces.},

abstract = {Of the sequence comparison methods, profile-based methods perform with greater selectively than those that use pairwise comparisons. Of the profile methods, hidden Markov models (HMMs) are apparently the best. The first part of this paper describes calculations that (i) improve the performance of HMMs and (ii) determine a good procedure for creating HMMs for sequences of proteins of known structure. For a family of related proteins, more homologues are detected using multiple models built from diverse single seed sequences than from one model built from a good alignment of those sequences. A new procedure is described for detecting and correcting those errors that arise at the model-building stage of the procedure. These two improvements greatly increase selectivity and coverage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe second part of the paper describes the construction of a library of HMMs, called SUPERFAMILY, that represent essentially all proteins of known structure. The sequences of the domains in proteins of known structure, that have identities less than 95 {\%}, are used as seeds to build the models. Using the current data, this gives a library with 4894 models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe third part of the paper describes the use of the SUPERFAMILY model library to annotate the sequences of over 50 genomes. The models match twice as many target sequences as are matched by pairwise sequence comparison methods. For each genome, close to half of the sequences are matched in all or in part and, overall, the matches cover 35 {\%} of eukaryotic genomes and 45 {\%} of bacterial genomes. On average roughly 15{\%} of genome sequences are labelled as being hypothetical yet homologous to proteins of known structure. The annotations derived from these matches are available from a public web server at: http://stash.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY. This server also enables users to match their own sequences against the SUPERFAMILY model library.},

abstract = {Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) of the H/ACA box and C/D box categories guide the pseudouridylation and the 2'-O-ribose methylation of ribosomal RNAs by forming short duplexes with their target. Similarly, small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs) guide modifications of spliceosomal RNAs. The vast majority of vertebrate sno/scaRNAs are located in introns of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II and processed by exonucleolytic trimming after splicing. A bioinformatic search for orthologues of human sno/scaRNAs in sequenced mammalian genomes reveals the presence of species- or lineage-specific sno/scaRNA retroposons (sno/scaRTs) characterized by an A-rich tail and an approximately 14-bp target site duplication that corresponds to their insertion site, as determined by interspecific genomic alignments. Three classes of snoRTs are defined based on the extent of intron and exon sequences from the snoRNA parental host gene they contain. SnoRTs frequently insert in gene introns in the sense orientation at genomic hot spots shared with other genetic mobile elements. Previously characterized human snoRNAs are encoded in retroposons whose parental copies can be identified by phylogenic analysis, showing that snoRTs can be faithfully processed. These results identify snoRNAs as a new family of mobile genetic elements. The insertion of new snoRNA copies might constitute a safeguard mechanism by which the biological activity of snoRNAs is maintained in spite of the risk of mutations in the parental copy. I furthermore propose that retroposition followed by genetic drift is a mechanism that increased snoRNA diversity during vertebrate evolution to eventually acquire new RNA-modification functions.},

@article{Bragg2013,
abstract = {The Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) is a new sequencing platform that substantially differs from other sequencing technologies by measuring pH rather than light to detect polymerisation events. Using re-sequencing datasets, we comprehensively characterise the biases and errors introduced by the PGM at both the base and flow level, across a combination of factors, including chip density, sequencing kit, template species and machine. We found two distinct insertion/deletion (indel) error types that accounted for the majority of errors introduced by the PGM. The main error source was inaccurate flow-calls, which introduced indels at a raw rate of 2.84{\%} (1.38{\%} after quality clipping) using the OneTouch 200 bp kit. Inaccurate flow-calls typically resulted in over-called short-homopolymers and under-called long-homopolymers. Flow-call accuracy decreased with consecutive flow cycles, but we also found significant periodic fluctuations in the flow error-rate, corresponding to specific positions within the flow-cycle pattern. Another less common PGM error, high frequency indel (HFI) errors, are indels that occur at very high frequency in the reads relative to a given base position in the reference genome, but in the majority of instances were not replicated consistently across separate runs. HFI errors occur approximately once every thousand bases in the reference, and correspond to 0.06{\%} of bases in reads. Currently, the PGM does not achieve the accuracy of competing light-based technologies. However, flow-call inaccuracy is systematic and the statistical models of flow-values developed here will enable PGM-specific bioinformatics approaches to be developed, which will account for these errors. HFI errors may prove more challenging to address, especially for polymorphism and amplicon applications, but may be overcome by sequencing the same DNA template across multiple chips.},

Despite the many advantages of next-generation sequencers, e.g., the high-throughput sequencing rate and relatively low cost of sequencing, the assembly of the reads produced by these sequencers still remains a major challenge. In this review, we address the basic framework of next-generation genome sequence assemblers, which comprises four basic stages: preprocessing filtering, a graph construction process, a graph simplification process, and postprocessing filtering. Here we discuss them as a framework of four stages for data analysis and processing and survey variety of techniques, algorithms, and software tools used during each stage. We also discuss the challenges that face current assemblers in the next-generation environment to determine the current state-of-the-art. We recommend a layered architecture approach for constructing a general assembler that can handle the sequences generated by different sequencing platforms.},

abstract = {With few exceptions, current methods for short read mapping make use of simple seed heuristics to speed up the search. Most of the underlying matching models neglect the necessity to allow not only mismatches, but also insertions and deletions. Current evaluations indicate, however, that very different error models apply to the novel high-throughput sequencing methods. While the most frequent error-type in Illumina reads are mismatches, reads produced by 454's GS FLX predominantly contain insertions and deletions (indels). Even though 454 sequencers are able to produce longer reads, the method is frequently applied to small RNA (miRNA and siRNA) sequencing. Fast and accurate matching in particular of short reads with diverse errors is therefore a pressing practical problem. We introduce a matching model for short reads that can, besides mismatches, also cope with indels. It addresses different error models. For example, it can handle the problem of leading and trailing contaminations caused by primers and poly-A tails in transcriptomics or the length-dependent increase of error rates. In these contexts, it thus simplifies the tedious and error-prone trimming step. For efficient searches, our method utilizes index structures in the form of enhanced suffix arrays. In a comparison with current methods for short read mapping, the presented approach shows significantly increased performance not only for 454 reads, but also for Illumina reads. Our approach is implemented in the software segemehl available at http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/.},

@article{Starmer2006,
abstract = {In prokaryotes, Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences, nucleotides upstream from start codons on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are complementary to ribosomal RNA (rRNA), facilitate the initiation of protein synthesis. The location of SD sequences relative to start codons and the stability of the hybridization between the mRNA and the rRNA correlate with the rate of synthesis. Thus, accurate characterization of SD sequences enhances our understanding of how an organism's transcriptome relates to its cellular proteome. We implemented the Individual Nearest Neighbor Hydrogen Bond model for oligo-oligo hybridization and created a new metric, relative spacing (RS), to identify both the location and the hybridization potential of SD sequences by simulating the binding between mRNAs and single-stranded 16S rRNA 3' tails. In 18 prokaryote genomes, we identified 2,420 genes out of 58,550 where the strongest binding in the translation initiation region included the start codon, deviating from the expected location for the SD sequence of five to ten bases upstream. We designated these as RS+1 genes. Additional analysis uncovered an unusual bias of the start codon in that the majority of the RS+1 genes used GUG, not AUG. Furthermore, of the 624 RS+1 genes whose SD sequence was associated with a free energy release of less than -8.4 kcal/mol (strong RS+1 genes), 384 were within 12 nucleotides upstream of in-frame initiation codons. The most likely explanation for the unexpected location of the SD sequence for these 384 genes is mis-annotation of the start codon. In this way, the new RS metric provides an improved method for gene sequence annotation. The remaining strong RS+1 genes appear to have their SD sequences in an unexpected location that includes the start codon. Thus, our RS metric provides a new way to explore the role of rRNA-mRNA nucleotide hybridization in translation initiation.},

abstract = {The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of sequence similarities that are sufficient to establish homology. In some cases, such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities, and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them, evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived, and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seed alignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a previously published set of 3,332 predicted structured elements in the Ciona intestinalis genome (Missal K, Rose D, Stadler PF (2005) Noncoding RNAs in Ciona intestinalis. Bioinformatics 21 (Supplement 2): i77-i78). In addition to recovering, e.g., tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for which to date no representative has been experimentally characterized.},

abstract = {The assumption that RNA can be readily classified into either protein-coding or non-protein-coding categories has pervaded biology for close to 50 years. Until recently, discrimination between these two categories was relatively straightforward: most transcripts were clearly identifiable as protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and readily distinguished from the small number of well-characterized non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as transfer, ribosomal, and spliceosomal RNAs. Recent genome-wide studies have revealed the existence of thousands of noncoding transcripts, whose function and significance are unclear. The discovery of this hidden transcriptome and the implicit challenge it presents to our understanding of the expression and regulation of genetic information has made the need to distinguish between mRNAs and ncRNAs both more pressing and more complicated. In this Review, we consider the diverse strategies employed to discriminate between protein-coding and noncoding transcripts and the fundamental difficulties that are inherent in what may superficially appear to be a simple problem. Misannotations can also run in both directions: some ncRNAs may actually encode peptides, and some of those currently thought to do so may not. Moreover, recent studies have shown that some RNAs can function both as mRNAs and intrinsically as functional ncRNAs, which may be a relatively widespread phenomenon. We conclude that it is difficult to annotate an RNA unequivocally as protein-coding or noncoding, with overlapping protein-coding and noncoding transcripts further confounding this distinction. In addition, the finding that some transcripts can function both intrinsically at the RNA level and to encode proteins suggests a false dichotomy between mRNAs and ncRNAs. Therefore, the functionality of any transcript at the RNA level should not be discounted.},

Despite this heterozygosity, the current genome assembly (∼1.1 Gb) includes 917 Mb of sequence assigned to specific turkey chromosomes. Annotation identified nearly 16,000 genes, with 15,093 recognized as protein coding and 611 as non-coding RNA genes. Comparative analysis of the turkey, chicken, and zebra finch genomes, and comparing avian to mammalian species, supports the characteristic stability of avian genomes and identifies genes unique to the avian lineage. Clear differences are seen in number and variety of genes of the avian immune system where expansions and novel genes are less frequent than examples of gene loss. The turkey genome sequence provides resources to further understand the evolution of vertebrate genomes and genetic variation underlying economically important quantitative traits in poultry.

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression
in plants and animals. Although their biological importance has become
clear, how they recognize and regulate target genes remains less
well understood. Here, we systematically evaluate the minimal requirements
for functional miRNA-target duplexes in vivo and distinguish classes
of target sites with different functional properties. Target sites
can be grouped into two broad categories. 5' dominant sites have
sufficient complementarity to the miRNA 5' end to function with little
or no support from pairing to the miRNA 3' end. Indeed, sites with
3' pairing below the random noise level are functional given a strong
5' end. In contrast, 3' compensatory sites have insufficient 5' pairing
and require strong 3' pairing for function. We present examples and
genome-wide statistical support to show that both classes of sites
are used in biologically relevant genes. We provide evidence that
an average miRNA has approximately 100 target sites, indicating that
miRNAs regulate a large fraction of protein-coding genes and that
miRNA 3' ends are key determinants of target specificity within miRNA
families.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with target mRNAs at specific sites to induce cleavage of the message or inhibit translation. The specific function of most mammalian miRNAs is unknown. We have predicted target sites on the 3' untranslated regions of human gene transcripts for all currently known 218 mammalian miRNAs to facilitate focused experiments. We report about 2,000 human genes with miRNA target sites conserved in mammals and about 250 human genes conserved as targets between mammals and fish. The prediction algorithm optimizes sequence complementarity using position-specific rules and relies on strict requirements of interspecies conservation. Experimental support for the validity of the method comes from known targets and from strong enrichment of predicted targets in mRNAs associated with the fragile X mental retardation protein in mammals. This is consistent with the hypothesis that miRNAs act as sequence-specific adaptors in the interaction of ribonuclear particles with translationally regulated messages. Overrepresented groups of targets include mRNAs coding for transcription factors, components of the miRNA machinery, and other proteins involved in translational regulation, as well as components of the ubiquitin machinery, representing novel feedback loops in gene regulation. Detailed information about target genes, target processes, and open-source software for target prediction (miRanda) is available at http://www.microrna.org. Our analysis suggests that miRNA genes, which are about 1{\%} of all human genes, regulate protein production for 10{\%} or more of all human genes.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules that regulate gene expression
by binding to target messenger RNAs and by controlling protein production
or causing RNA cleavage. To date, functions have been assigned to
only a few of the hundreds of identified miRNAs, in part because
of the difficulty in identifying their targets. The short length
of miRNAs and the fact that their complementarity to target sequences
is imperfect mean that target identification in animal genomes is
not possible by standard sequence comparison methods. Here we screen
conserved 3' UTR sequences from the Drosophila melanogaster genome
for potential miRNA targets. The screening procedure combines a sequence
search with an evaluation of the predicted miRNA-target heteroduplex
structures and energies. We show that this approach successfully
identifies the five previously validated let-7, lin-4, and bantam
targets from a large database and predict new targets for Drosophila
miRNAs. Our target predictions reveal striking clusters of functionally
related targets among the top predictions for specific miRNAs. These
include Notch target genes for miR-7, proapoptotic genes for the
miR-2 family, and enzymes from a metabolic pathway for miR-277. We
experimentally verified three predicted targets each for miR-7 and
the miR-2 family, doubling the number of validated targets for animal
miRNAs. Statistical analysis indicates that the best single predicted
target sites are at the border of significance; thus, target predictions
should be considered as tentative until experimentally validated.
We identify features shared by all validated targets that can be
used to evaluate target predictions for animal miRNAs. Our initial
evaluation and experimental validation of target predictions suggest
functions for two miRNAs. For others, the screen suggests plausible
functions, such as a role for miR-277 as a metabolic switch controlling
amino acid catabolism. Cross-genome comparison proved essential,
as it allows reduction of the sequence search space. Improvements
in genome annotation and increased availability of cDNA sequences
from other genomes will allow more sensitive screens. An increase
in the number of confirmed targets is expected to reveal general
structural features that can be used to improve their detection.
While the screen is likely to miss some targets, our study shows
that valid targets can be identified from sequence alone.},

abstract = {This work investigates the possible causes of cold-induced sweetening in potato by examining the impact of low temperature on carbohydrate metabolism in mature tubers. Metabolism in tuber discs was monitored by determining the redistribution of radiolabel following incubation in [U-(14)C]glucose. Estimates of flux based on the specific activity of hexose phosphates established that while incubation at 4 degrees C resulted in an immediate restriction in pathways of carbohydrate oxidation relative to activity at 25 degrees C, there was no corresponding increase in flux to soluble sugars. In contrast, prior storage at low temperature stimulated flux to sugars at both 4 and 25 degrees C. Comparison of (14)CO(2) release from specifically labeled glucose and gluconate fed to tuber discs at 4 and 25 degrees C indicated that flux through glycolysis was preferentially restricted relative to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway at low temperature, irrespective of prior storage temperature. However, the degree of randomization of label between positions C1 and C6 in the fructosyl moiety of sucrose following metabolism of [1-(13)C]glucose established that there was no preferential inhibition of the recycling of triose phosphates to hexose phosphates at low temperature. These results indicate that sugar accumulation in tubers during storage in the cold is not a direct consequence of a constraint in carbohydrate oxidation, despite preferential restriction of glycolysis at low temperature. It is concluded that the cold lability of enzymes catalyzing the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is not a major factor in cold-induced sweetening in plants and that this widely held hypothesis should be abandoned.},

The species delineation of this yeast species urgently needs clarification. The heterogeneity in taxonomic characteristics has resulted in the description of varieties linked to D. hansenii. The aim of this study was to re-examine and classify D. hansenii using a polyphasic approach. A total of 65 D.hansenii isolates were examined, 57 representing the variety hansenii and nine the variety fabryi. The selection of strains for DNA reassociation and phylogenetic analysis was based on polymerase chain reaction mediated fingerprints using four mini- and microsatellite-specific primers. The discriminating power of growth at 35 degrees C and 37 degrees C was re-examined and ascospore production was observed. DNA reassociations and phylogenetic analyses were performed on selected isolates from each of the clusters obtained from the DNA fingerprint analyses. The data indicated the presence of three distinct species within the D. hansenii group, which were represented by type strains of former species and that are proposed to be reinstated: D. hansenii (CBS 767(T) = MUCL 49680(T)), D. fabryi (CBS 789(T) = MUCL 49731(T)) and D. subglobosus (CBS 792(T) = MUCL 49732(T)).},

Most taxa are also found to cause cutaneous or disseminated infections in cold-blooded, water animals, occasionally reaching epidemic proportions. Hosts are mainly fish, frogs, toads, turtles or crabs, all sharing smooth, moist or mucous skins and waterborne or amphibian lifestyles; occasionally superficial infections in humans are noted. Cold-blooded animals with strictly terrestrial life styles, such as reptiles and birds are missing. It is concluded that animals with moist skins, i.e. those being waterborne and those possessing sweat glands, are more susceptible to black yeast infection. Melanin and the ability to assimilate alkylbenzenes are purported general virulence factors. Thermotolerance influences the choice of host. Exophiala species in ocean water mostly have maximum growth temperatures below 30 °C, whereas those able to grow until 33(-36) °C are found in shallow waters and occasionally on humans. Tissue responses vary with the phylogenetic position of the host, the lower animals showing poor granulome formation.

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that repress protein
synthesis by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in multicellular
eukaryotes. The mechanism by which animal miRNAs specifically recognize
their targets is not well understood. We recently developed a model
for modeling the interaction between a miRNA and a target as a two-step
hybridization reaction: nucleation at an accessible target site,
followed by hybrid elongation to disrupt local target secondary structure
and form the complete miRNA-target duplex. Nucleation potential and
hybridization energy are two key energetic characteristics of the
model. In this model, the role of target secondary structure on the
efficacy of repression by miRNAs is considered, by employing the
Sfold program to address the likelihood of a population of structures
that co-exist in dynamic equilibrium for a specific mRNA molecule.
This model can accurately account for the sensitivity to repression
by let-7 of both published and rationally designed mutant forms of
the Caenorhabditis elegans lin-41 3' UTR, and for the behavior of
many other experimentally-tested miRNA-target interactions in C.
elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. The model is particularly effective
in accounting for certain false positive predictions obtained by
other methods. In this study, we employed this model to analyze a
set of miRNA-target interactions that were experimentally tested
in mammalian models. These include targets for both mammalian miRNAs
and viral miRNAs, and a viral target of a human miRNA. We found that
our model can well account for both positive interactions and negative
interactions. The model provides a unique explanation for the lack
of function of a conserved seed site in the 3' UTR of the viral target,
and predicts a strong interaction that cannot be predicted by conservation-based
methods. Thus, the findings from this analysis and the previous analysis
suggest that target structural accessibility is generally important
for miRNA function in a broad class of eukaryotic systems. The model
can be combined with other algorithms to improve the specificity
of predictions by these algorithms. Because the model does not involve
sequence conservation, it is readily applicable to target identification
for microRNAs that lack conserved sites, non-conserved human miRNAs,
and poorly conserved viral mRNAs. StarMir is a new Sfold application
module developed for the implementation of the structure-based model,
and is available through Sfold Web server at http://sfold.wadsworth.org.},

abstract = {The human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) preadipocyte cell strain provides a unique and useful tool for studies of human adipocyte biology. The cells originate from an adipose tissue specimen of a patient with SGBS. They are neither transformed nor immortalized, and provide an almost unlimited source due to their ability to proliferate for up to 50 generations with retained capacity for adipogenic differentiation. So far, the cells have been used for a number of studies on adipose differentiation, adipocyte glucose uptake, lipolysis, apoptosis, regulation of expression of adipokines, and protein translocation. The cells are efficiently differentiated in the presence of PPARgammaagonists and in the absence of serum and albumin. SGBS adipocytes respond to insulin stimulation by increasing glucose uptake several-fold (EC50 approximately 100 pmol/l), and by very effectively inhibiting (IC50 approximately 10 pmol/l) catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis.},

abstract = {The interpretation of data-driven experiments in genomics often involves a search for biological categories that are enriched for the responder genes identified by the experiments. However, knowledge bases such as the Gene Ontology (GO) contain hundreds or thousands of categories with very high overlap between categories. Thus, enrichment analysis performed on one category at a time frequently returns large numbers of correlated categories, leaving the choice of the most relevant ones to the user's; interpretation. Here we present model-based gene set analysis (MGSA) that analyzes all categories at once by embedding them in a Bayesian network, in which gene response is modeled as a function of the activation of biological categories. Probabilistic inference is used to identify the active categories. The Bayesian modeling approach naturally takes category overlap into account and avoids the need for multiple testing corrections met in single-category enrichment analysis. On simulated data, MGSA identifies active categories with up to 95{\{}{\%}{\}} precision at a recall of 20{\{}{\%}{\}} for moderate settings of noise, leading to a 10-fold precision improvement over single-category statistical enrichment analysis. Application to a gene expression data set in yeast demonstrates that the method provides high-level, summarized views of core biological processes and correctly eliminates confounding associations.},

We have developed circRNA-seq, a combined experimental/computational approach that enriches for circular RNAs and allows profiling their prevalence in a whole-genome, unbiased manner.

The identified circular RNAs included expected forms, such as excised tRNA introns and rRNA processing intermediates, but were also enriched with non-coding RNAs, including C/D box RNAs and RNase P, as well as circular RNAs of unknown function. Many of the identified circles were conserved in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, further supporting their functional significance. Our results suggest that circular RNAs, and particularly circular non-coding RNAs, are more prevalent in archaea than previously recognized, and might have yet unidentified biological roles.

To that aim, we experimentally screened for ncRNAs, expressed under various growth conditions or during specific developmental stages, by generating a specialized cDNA library from size-selected small RNA species. Our screen revealed 30 novel ncRNA candidates from known ncRNA classes such as small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and C/D box-type small nucleolar RNAs (C/D box snoRNAs). Additionally, several candidates for H/ACA box snoRNAs could be predicted by a bioinformatical screen. We also identified 15 candidates for ncRNAs, which could not be assigned to any known ncRNA class. Some of these ncRNA species are developmentally regulated implying a possible novel function in A. fumigatus development. Surprisingly, in addition to full-length tRNAs, we also identified 5'- or 3'-halves of tRNAs, only, which are likely generated by tRNA cleavage within the anti-codon loop.

Its reduced susceptibility to antifungal drugs and its close relationship to Saccharomyces cerevisiae make it an interesting research focus. Although its genome sequence was published in 2004, little is known about its transcriptional dynamics. Here, we provide a detailed RNA-Seq-based analysis of the transcriptomic landscape of C. glabrata in nutrient-rich media, as well as under nitrosative stress and during pH shift. Using RNA-Seq data together with state-of-the-art gene prediction tools, we refined the annotation of the C. glabrata genome and predicted 49 novel protein-coding genes. Of these novel genes, 14 have homologs in S. cerevisiae and six are shared with other Candida species. We experimentally validated four novel protein-coding genes of which two are differentially regulated during pH shift and interaction with human neutrophils, indicating a potential role in host-pathogen interaction. Furthermore, we identified 58 novel non-protein-coding genes, 38 new introns and condition-specific alternative splicing. Finally, our data suggest different patterns of adaptation to pH shift and nitrosative stress in C. glabrata, Candida albicans and S. cerevisiae and thus further underline a distinct evolution of virulence in yeast.},

To this end, CPAT uses a logistic regression model built with four sequence features: open reading frame size, open reading frame coverage, Fickett TESTCODE statistic and hexamer usage bias. CPAT software outperformed (sensitivity: 0.96, specificity: 0.97) other state-of-the-art alignment-based software such as Coding-Potential Calculator (sensitivity: 0.99, specificity: 0.74) and Phylo Codon Substitution Frequencies (sensitivity: 0.90, specificity: 0.63). In addition to high accuracy, CPAT is approximately four orders of magnitude faster than Coding-Potential Calculator and Phylo Codon Substitution Frequencies, enabling its users to process thousands of transcripts within seconds. The software accepts input sequences in either FASTA- or BED-formatted data files. We also developed a web interface for CPAT that allows users to submit sequences and receive the prediction results almost instantly.},

abstract = {The pathogen-host interaction database (PHI-base) is a web-accessible database that catalogues experimentally verified pathogenicity, virulence and effector genes from bacterial, fungal and Oomycete pathogens, which infect human, animal, plant, insect, fish and fungal hosts. Plant endophytes are also included. PHI-base is therefore an invaluable resource for the discovery of genes in medically and agronomically important pathogens, which may be potential targets for chemical intervention. The database is freely accessible to both academic and non-academic users. This publication describes recent additions to the database and both current and future applications. The number of fields that characterize PHI-base entries has almost doubled. Important additional fields deal with new experimental methods, strain information, pathogenicity islands and external references that link the database to external resources, for example, gene ontology terms and Locus IDs. Another important addition is the inclusion of anti-infectives and their target genes that makes it possible to predict the compounds, that may interact with newly identified virulence factors. In parallel, the curation process has been improved and now involves several external experts. On the technical side, several new search tools have been provided and the database is also now distributed in XML format. PHI-base is available at: http://www.phi-base.org/.},

AspGD curators perform gene product annotation based on review of the literature for four key Aspergillus species: Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger. We have iteratively improved the structural annotation of Aspergillus genomes through the analysis of publicly available transcription data, mostly expressed sequenced tags, as described in a previous NAR Database article (Arnaud et al. 2012). In this update, we report substantive structural annotation improvements for A. nidulans, A. oryzae and A. fumigatus genomes based on recently available RNA-Seq data.

However, it still has to be elucidated which of these transcripts represent functional ncRNAs. Since all functional ncRNAs in Eukarya form ribonucleo-protein particles (RNPs), we generated specialized cDNA libraries from size-fractionated RNPs and validated the presence of selected ncRNAs within RNPs by glycerol gradient centrifugation. As a proof of concept, we applied the RNP method to human Hela cells or total mouse brain, and subjected cDNA libraries, generated from the two model systems, to deep-sequencing. Bioinformatical analysis of cDNA sequences revealed several hundred ncRNP candidates. Thereby, ncRNAs candidates were mainly located in intergenic as well as intronic regions of the genome, with a significant overrepresentation of intron-derived ncRNA sequences. Additionally, a number of ncRNAs mapped to repetitive sequences. Thus, our RNP approach provides an efficient way to identify new functional small ncRNA candidates, involved in RNP formation.},

The PATRIC infrastructure consists of a relational database, analytical pipelines and a website which supports browsing, querying, data visualization and the ability to download raw and curated data in standard formats. At present, the site warehouses complete sequences for 17 bacterial and 332 viral genomes.

abstract = {enod40 is a plant gene that participates in the regulation of symbiotic interaction between leguminous plants and bacteria or fungi. Furthermore, it has been suggested to play a general role in non-symbiotic plant development. Although enod40 seems to have multiple functions, being present in many land plants, the molecular mechanisms of its activity are unclear; they may be determined though, by short peptides and/or RNA structures encoded in the enod40 genes. We utilized conserved RNA structures in enod40 sequences to search nucleotide sequence databases and identified a number of new enod40 homologues in plant species that belong to known, but also, to yet unknown enod40-containing plant families. RNA secondary structure predictions and comparative sequence analysis of enod40 RNAs allowed us to determine the most conserved structural features, present in all known enod40 genes. Remarkably, the topology and evolution of one of the conserved structural domains are similar to those of the expansion segments found in structural RNAs such as rRNAs, RNase P and SRP RNAs. Surprisingly, the enod40 RNA structural elements are much more stronger conserved than the encoded peptides. This finding suggests that some general functions of enod40 gene could be determined by the encoded RNA structure, whereas short peptides may be responsible for more diverse functions found only in certain plant families.},

abstract = {Circular RNA forms had been described in all domains of life. Such RNAs were shown to have diverse biological functions, including roles in the life cycle of viral and viroid genomes, and in maturation of permuted tRNA genes. Despite their potentially important biological roles, discovery of circular RNAs has so far been mostly serendipitous. We have developed circRNA-seq, a combined experimental/computational approach that enriches for circular RNAs and allows profiling their prevalence in a whole-genome, unbiased manner. Application of this approach to the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 revealed multiple circular transcripts, a subset of which was further validated independently. The identified circular RNAs included expected forms, such as excised tRNA introns and rRNA processing intermediates, but were also enriched with non-coding RNAs, including C/D box RNAs and RNase P, as well as circular RNAs of unknown function. Many of the identified circles were conserved in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, further supporting their functional significance. Our results suggest that circular RNAs, and particularly circular non-coding RNAs, are more prevalent in archaea than previously recognized, and might have yet unidentified biological roles. Our study establishes a specific and sensitive approach for identification of circular RNAs using RNA-seq, and can readily be applied to other organisms.},

From these genes one wants to identify biological pathways that may be involved and diseases that may be implicated. Here, we report a web server, KOBAS 2.0, which annotates an input set of genes with putative pathways and disease relationships based on mapping to genes with known annotations. It allows for both ID mapping and cross-species sequence similarity mapping. It then performs statistical tests to identify statistically significantly enriched pathways and diseases. KOBAS 2.0 incorporates knowledge across 1327 species from 5 pathway databases (KEGG PATHWAY, PID, BioCyc, Reactome and Panther) and 5 human disease databases (OMIM, KEGG DISEASE, FunDO, GAD and NHGRI GWAS Catalog). KOBAS 2.0 can be accessed at http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn.},

abstract = {The function of many non-coding RNA genes and cis-regulatory elements of messenger RNA largely depends on the structure, which is in turn determined by their sequence. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other mutations may disrupt the RNA structure, interfere with the molecular function and hence cause a phenotypic effect. RNAsnp is an efficient method to predict the effect of SNPs on local RNA secondary structure based on the RNA folding algorithms implemented in the Vienna RNA package. The SNP effects are quantified in terms of empirical P-values, which, for computational efficiency, are derived from extensive pre-computed tables of distributions of substitution effects as a function of gene length and GC content. Here, we present a web service that not only provides an interface for RNAsnp but also features a graphical output representation. In addition, the web server is connected to a local mirror of the UCSC genome browser database that enables the users to select the genomic sequences for analysis and visualize the results directly in the UCSC genome browser.

abstract = {In this study, we describe a method of simultaneous conditional gene silencing of up to four genes in Escherichia coli by using antisense RNAs. We used antisense RNAs with paired termini, which carried flanking inverted repeats to create paired double-stranded RNA termini; these RNAs have been proven to have high silencing efficacy. To express antisense RNAs, we constructed four IPTG-inducible vectors carrying different but compatible replication origins. When the lacZ antisense RNA was expressed using these vectors, lacZ expression was successfully silenced by all the vectors, but the expression level of the antisense RNA and silencing efficacy differed depending on the used vectors. All the vectors were co-transformable; the antisense RNAs against lacZ, ackA, pta and pepN were co-expressed, and silencing of all the target genes was confirmed. Furthermore, when antisense RNAs were targeted to the mutator genes mutS, mutD (dnaQ) and ndk, which are involved in DNA replication or DNA mismatch repair, spontaneous mutation frequencies increased over 2000-fold. The resulting mutator strain is useful for random mutagenesis of plasmids. The method provides a robust tool for investigating functional relationships between multiple genes or altering cell phenotypes for biotechnological and industrial applications.},

abstract = {Synthetic in vivo molecular computers could rewire biological processes by establishing programmable, non-native pathways between molecular signals and biological responses. Multiple molecular computer prototypes have been shown to work in simple buffered solutions. Many of those prototypes were made of DNA strands and performed computations using cycles of annealing-digestion or strand displacement. We have previously introduced RNA interference (RNAi)-based computing as a way of implementing complex molecular logic in vivo. Because it also relies on nucleic acids for its operation, RNAi computing could benefit from the tools developed for DNA systems. However, these tools must be harnessed to produce bioactive components and be adapted for harsh operating environments that reflect in vivo conditions. In a step toward this goal, we report the construction and implementation of biosensors that transduce mRNA levels into bioactive, small interfering RNA molecules via RNA strand exchange in a cell-free Drosophila embryo lysate, a step beyond simple buffered environments. We further integrate the sensors with our RNAi computational module to evaluate two-input logic functions on mRNA concentrations. Our results show how RNA strand exchange can expand the utility of RNAi computing and point toward the possibility of using strand exchange in a native biological setting.},

In eukaryotes, these proteinRNA complexes localize to the nucleolus and are called small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs), while in archaea they are known as small RNPs (sRNP). The C/D class of sno(s)RNPs carries out ribose-2-O-methylation, while the H/ACA class is responsible for pseudouridylation of their RNA targets. Here, we review the recent advances in the structure, assembly and function of the conserved C/D and H/ACA sno(s)RNPs. Structures of each of the core archaeal sRNP proteins have been determined and their assembly pathways delineated. Furthermore, the recent structure of an H/ACA complex has revealed the organization of a complete sRNP. Combined with current biochemical data, these structures offer insight into the highly homologous eukaryotic snoRNPs.},

abstract = {H/ACA RNP complexes change uridines to pseudouridines in target non-coding RNAs in eukaryotes and archaea. H/ACA RNPs are comprised of a guide RNA and four essential proteins: Cbf5 (pseudouridine synthase), L7Ae, Gar1 and Nop10 in archaea. The guide RNA captures the target RNA via two antisense elements brought together to form a contiguous binding site within the pseudouridylation pocket (internal loop) of the guide RNA. Cbf5 and L7Ae interact independently with the guide RNA, and here we have examined the impacts of these proteins on the RNA in nucleotide protection assays. The results indicate that the interactions observed in a fully assembled H/ACA RNP are established in the sub-complexes, but also reveal a unique Cbf5-guide RNA interaction that is displaced by L7Ae. In addition, the results indicate that L7Ae binding at the kink (k)-turn of the guide RNA induces the formation of the upper stem, and thus also the pseudouridylation pocket. Our findings indicate that L7Ae is essential for formation of the substrate RNA binding site in the archaeal H/ACA RNP, and suggest that k-turn-binding proteins may remodel partner RNAs with important effects distant from the protein-binding site.},

About 96{\%} of the box H/ACA RNA-related sequences are found in corresponding locations on the chimpanzee and human chromosomes, while the mouse shares approximately 50{\%} of these human sequences, suggesting that some of the H/ACA RNA-related sequences in primate occurred after the rodent/primate divergence. Of the H/ACA RNA-related sequences, 49{\%} are found in intronic regions of protein-coding genes and 64 H/ACA-related sequences can be folded to the typical secondary structure of the box H/ACA snoRNA family, while 30 of them were recognized as functional homologs of their corresponding box H/ACA snoRNAs previously reported. Of the 64 sequences with the typical secondary structure of the box H/ACA RNA family, 11 were found in EST databases and 5 among which were shown to be expressed in more than one human tissue. Notably, U107f is nested in an intron of a protein gene coding for nudix-type motif 13, but expressed from the opposite strand, and the searching of EST databases revealed it can be expressed in liver and spleen, even in melanotic melanoma.},

abstract = {Using a powerful computer-assisted analysis strategy, a large-scale search of small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes in the recently released draft sequence of the rice genome was carried out. This analysis identified 120 different box C/D snoRNA genes with a total of 346 gene variants, which were predicted to guide 135 2'-O-ribose methylation sites in rice rRNAs. Though not exhaustive, this analysis has revealed that rice has the highest number of known box C/D snoRNAs among eukaryotes. Interestingly, although many snoRNA genes are conserved between rice and Arabidopsis, almost half of the identified snoRNA genes are rice specific, which may highlight further the differences in rRNA methylation patterns between monocotyledons and dicotyledons. In addition to 76 singletons, 70 clusters involving 270 snoRNA genes were also found in rice. The large number of the novel snoRNA polycistrons found in the introns of rice protein-coding genes is in contrast to the one-snoRNA-per-intron organization of vertebrates and yeast, and of Arabidopsis in which only a few intronic snoRNA gene clusters were identified. Furthermore, due to a high degree of gene duplication, rice snoRNA genes are clearly redundant and exhibit great sequence variation among isoforms, allowing generation of new snoRNAs for selection. Thus, the large snoRNA gene family in plants can serve as an excellent model for a rapid and functional evolution.},

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), one of the largest classes of npcRNAs, guide post-transcriptional modifications of other RNAs that are crucial for appropriate RNA folding as well as for RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. Although snoRNA genes comprise a significant fraction of the eutherian genome, identifying and characterizing large numbers of them is not sufficiently accessible by classical computer searches alone. Furthermore, most previous investigations of snoRNAs yielded only limited indications of their evolution. Using data obtained by a combination of high-throughput cDNA library screening and computational search strategies based on a modified DNAMAN program, we characterized 151 npcRNAs, and in particular 121 snoRNAs, from Caenorhabditis elegans and extensively compared them with those in the related, Caenorhabditis briggsae. Detailed comparisons of paralog snoRNAs in the two nematodes revealed, in addition to trans-duplication, a novel, cis-duplication distribution strategy with insertions near to the original loci. Some snoRNAs coevolved with their modification target sites, demonstrating the close interaction of complementary regions. Some target sites modified by snoRNAs were changed, added or lost, documenting a high degree of evolutionary plasticity of npcRNAs.},

Here we present sRNA-Seq, an unbiased method that allows for interrogation of the entire small, non-coding RNA (sRNA) repertoire in any prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism. This method includes a novel treatment that depletes total RNA fractions of highly abundant tRNAs and small subunit rRNA, thereby enriching the starting pool for sRNA transcripts with novel functionality. As a proof-of-principle, we applied sRNA-Seq to the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Our results provide information, at unprecedented depth, on the complexity of the sRNA component of a bacterial transcriptome. From 407 039 sequence reads, all 20 known V. cholerae sRNAs, 500 new, putative intergenic sRNAs and 127 putative antisense sRNAs were identified in a limited number of growth conditions examined. In addition, characterization of a subset of the newly identified transcripts led to the identification of a novel sRNA regulator of carbon metabolism. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that the number of sRNAs in bacteria has been greatly underestimated and that future efforts to analyze bacterial transcriptomes will benefit from direct cloning and parallel sequencing experiments aided by 5S/tRNA depletion.},

A fundamental step in this process requires the characterization of regulatory motifs playing key roles in the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In particular, transcription is modulated by the interaction of transcription factors with their corresponding binding sites. Weeder Web is a web interface to Weeder, an algorithm for the automatic discovery of conserved motifs in a set of related regulatory DNA sequences. The motifs found are in turn likely to be instances of binding sites for some transcription factor. Other than providing access to the program, the interface has been designed so to make usage of the program itself as simple as possible, and to require very little prior knowledge about the length and the conservation of the motifs to be found. In fact, the interface automatically starts different runs of the program, each one with different parameters, and provides the user with an overall summary of the results as well as some 'advice' on which motifs look more interesting according to their statistical significance and some simple considerations.

Our system has been thoroughly tested during the annotation of complete bacterial genomes (Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, Frankia alni) and is currently used in the context of several new microbial genome annotation projects. In addition, MaGe allows for annotation curation and exploration of already published genomes from various genera (e.g. Yersinia, Bacillus and Neisseria).

Recently, numerous sRNAs and their targets were identified in Escherichia coli and in other bacteria. It is crucial to have a comprehensive resource concerning the annotation of small non-coding RNAs in microbial genomes. This work presents an integrated database, namely sRNAMap, to collect the sRNA genes, the transcriptional regulators of sRNAs and the sRNA target genes by integrating a variety of biological databases and by surveying literature. In this resource, we collected 397 sRNAs, 62 regulators/sRNAs and 60 sRNAs/targets in 70 microbial genomes. Additionally, more valuable information of the sRNAs, such as the secondary structure of sRNAs, the expressed conditions of sRNAs, the expression profiles of sRNAs, the transcriptional start sites of sRNAs and the cross-links to other biological databases, are provided for further investigation. Besides, various textual and graphical interfaces were designed and implemented to facilitate the data access in sRNAMap. sRNAMap is available at http://sRNAMap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.},

abstract = {The growth in the number of completely sequenced microbial genomes (bacterial and archaeal) has generated a need for a procedure that provides UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot-quality annotation to as many protein sequences as possible. We have devised a semi-automated system, HAMAP (High-quality Automated and Manual Annotation of microbial Proteomes), that uses manually built annotation templates for protein families to propagate annotation to all members of manually defined protein families, using very strict criteria. The HAMAP system is composed of two databases, the proteome database and the family database, and of an automatic annotation pipeline. The proteome database comprises biological and sequence information for each completely sequenced microbial proteome, and it offers several tools for CDS searches, BLAST options and retrieval of specific sets of proteins. The family database currently comprises more than 1500 manually curated protein families and their annotation templates that are used to annotate proteins that belong to one of the HAMAP families. On the HAMAP website, individual sequences as well as whole genomes can be scanned against all HAMAP families. The system provides warnings for the absence of conserved amino acid residues, unusual sequence length, etc. Thanks to the implementation of HAMAP, more than 200,000 microbial proteins have been fully annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (HAMAP website: http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hamap).},

abstract = {Although cis-regulatory binding sites (CRBSs) are at least as important as the coding sequences in a genome, our general understanding of them in most sequenced genomes is very limited due to the lack of efficient and accurate experimental and computational methods for their characterization, which has largely hindered our understanding of many important biological processes. In this article, we describe a novel algorithm for genome-wide de novo prediction of CRBSs with high accuracy. We designed our algorithm to circumvent three identified difficulties for CRBS prediction using comparative genomics principles based on a new method for the selection of reference genomes, a new metric for measuring the similarity of CRBSs, and a new graph clustering procedure. When operon structures are correctly predicted, our algorithm can predict 81{\%} of known individual binding sites belonging to 94{\%} of known cis-regulatory motifs in the Escherichia coli K12 genome, while achieving high prediction specificity. Our algorithm has also achieved similar prediction accuracy in the Bacillus subtilis genome, suggesting that it is very robust, and thus can be applied to any other sequenced prokaryotic genome. When compared with the prior state-of-the-art algorithms, our algorithm outperforms them in both prediction sensitivity and specificity.},

(2) Searching for similar operons: the database provides a search capability for a user to find operons that have similar composition and structure to a query operon. (3) Prediction of cis-regulatory motifs: the database provides a capability for motif identification in the promoter regions of a user-specified group of possibly coregulated operons, using motif-finding tools. (4) Operons for RNA genes: the database includes operons for RNA genes. (5) OperonWiki: the database provides a wiki page (OperonWiki) to facilitate interactions between users and the developer of the database.

The GeneMark. hmm algorithm presented here was designed to improve the gene prediction quality in terms of finding exact gene boundaries. The idea was to embed the GeneMark models into naturally derived hidden Markov model framework with gene boundaries modeled as transitions between hidden states. We also used the specially derived ribosome binding site pattern to refine predictions of translation initiation codons. The algorithm was evaluated on several test sets including 10 complete bacterial genomes. It was shown that the new algorithm is significantly more accurate than GeneMark in exact gene prediction. Interestingly, the high gene finding accuracy was observed even in the case when Markov models of order zero, one and two were used. We present the analysis of false positive and false negative predictions with the caution that these categories are not precisely defined if the public database annotation is used as a control.},

abstract = {The biological activity of siRNA seems to be influenced by local
characteristics of the target RNA, including local RNA folding. Here,
we investigated quantitatively the relationship between local target
accessibility and the extent of inhibition of the target gene by
siRNA. Target accessibility was assessed by a computational approach
that had been shown earlier to be consistent with experimental probing
of target RNA. Two sites of ICAM-1 mRNA predicted to serve as accessible
motifs and one site predicted to adopt an inaccessible structure
were chosen to test siRNA constructs for suppression of ICAM-1 gene
expression in ECV304 cells. The local target-dependent effectiveness
of siRNA was compared with antisense oligonucleotides (asON). The
concentration dependency of siRNA-mediated suppression indicates
a {\textgreater}1000-fold difference between active siRNAs (IC50 approximately
0.2-0.5 nM) versus an inactive siRNA (IC50 {\textgreater} or = 1 microM) which
is consistent with the activity pattern of asON when relating target
suppression to predicted local target accessibility. The extremely
high activity of the siRNA si2B (IC50 = 0.24 nM) indicates that not
all siRNAs shown to be active at the usual concentrations of {\textgreater}10-100
nM belong to this highly active species. The observations described
here suggest an option to assess target accessibility for siRNA and,
thus, support the design of active siRNA constructs. This approach
can be automated, work at high throughput and is open to include
additional parameters relevant to the biological activity of siRNA.},

abstract = {To identify noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, we analyzed the intergenic regions (IGRs) of strain EGD-e by in silico-based approaches. Among the twelve ncRNAs found, nine are novel and specific to the Listeria genus, and two of these ncRNAs are expressed in a growth-dependent manner. Three of the ncRNAs are transcribed in opposite direction to overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), suggesting that they act as antisense on the corresponding mRNAs. The other ncRNA genes appear as single transcription units. One of them displays five repeats of 29 nucleotides. Five of these new ncRNAs are absent from the non-pathogenic species L. innocua, raising the possibility that they might be involved in virulence. To predict mRNA targets of the ncRNAs, we developed a computational method based on thermodynamic pairing energies and known ncRNA-mRNA hybrids. Three ncRNAs, including one of the putative antisense ncRNAs, were predicted to have more than one mRNA targets. Several of them were shown to bind efficiently to the ncRNAs suggesting that our in silico approach could be used as a general tool to search for mRNA targets of ncRNAs.},

abstract = {Highly accurate knockdown functional analyses based on RNA interference
(RNAi) require the possible most complete hydrolysis of the targeted
mRNA while avoiding the degradation of untargeted genes (off-target
effects). This in turn requires significant improvements to target
selection for two reasons. First, the average silencing activity
of randomly selected siRNAs is as low as 62{\%}. Second, applying more
than five different siRNAs may lead to saturation of the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC) and to the degradation of untargeted genes.
Therefore, selecting a small number of highly active siRNAs is critical
for maximizing knockdown and minimizing off-target effects. To satisfy
these needs, a publicly available and transparent machine learning
tool is presented that ranks all possible siRNAs for each targeted
gene. Support vector machines (SVMs) with polynomial kernels and
constrained optimization models select and utilize the most predictive
effective combinations from 572 sequence, thermodynamic, accessibility
and self-hairpin features over 2200 published siRNAs. This tool reaches
an accuracy of 92.3{\%} in cross-validation experiments. We fully present
the underlying biophysical signature that involves free energy, accessibility
and dinucleotide characteristics. We show that while complete silencing
is possible at certain structured target sites, accessibility information

showed that siRNA is the most potent inhibitor of VR1-green fluorescent

an estimated IC50 of 0.06 nM. An LNA gapmer was found to be the most
efficient single-stranded antisense oligonucleotide, with an IC50
of 0.4 nM being 175-fold lower than that of commonly used phosphorothioates

the specificity of RNAi. Here, we present a study where a functionally
validated siRNA (siCD46) was examined for silencing specificity on
all possible 57 permutated target sites, each carrying a single-nucleotide
mutation that would generate a mismatch when paired with siRNA antisense
strand. We found that it was not only the position of the mismatched
base pair, but also the identity of the nucleotides forming the mismatch
that influenced silencing. Surprisingly, mismatches formed between
adenine (A) and cytosine (C), in addition to the G:U wobble base
pair, were well tolerated and target sites containing such mismatches
were silenced almost as efficiently as its fully matched counterpart
by siCD46. Northern blots showed that the silencing of fusion genes
harboring the mutated target sites involved target mRNA degradation.
This study provides direct evidence that the target recognition of
siRNA is far more degenerative than previously considered. This finding
is instrumental in the understanding of RNAi specificity and may

excludes inappropriate sequences before DeltaG (min) is calculated,
thereby reducing computation time drastically when compared with

by two related microRNAs, miR-206 and miR-1, that inhibit the expression

Cx43 mRNA levels. Cx43 mRNA contains two binding sites for miR-206/miR-1

downregulation. While it has been demonstrated before that miR-1

during myoblast fusion in vitro. Proper development of singly innervated
muscle fibers requires muscle contraction and NMJ terminal selection
and it is hypothesized that prolonged electrical coupling via gap

location of the target within a translated or a noncoding region

in two different orientations, only one orientation had a significant

a problem. Large gene families with significant similarity among
family members, such as the P450s, are particularly problematic.
Additionally, accurate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection

Conventional oligonucleotide probes that are perfectly matched to

Carefully designed mismatches can be used to decrease cross-hybridization

For each entry, the database identifies the modified nucleotide(s) in the target RNA(s), indicates the corresponding predicted base pairing, gives a few pertinent references and provides a link to the position of the sno/scaRNA on the UCSC Genome Browser. The 'Find guide RNA' function allows one to find the sno/scaRNAs predicted to guide the modification of a particular nucleotide in the rRNA and spliceosomal RNA sequences. The 'Browse' function allows one to download the sequences of selected sno/scaRNAs in the FASTA format. The database is available online at http://www-snorna.biotoul.fr/. It can also be accessed from the human UCSC Genome Browser via the sno/miRNA track.},

abstract = {Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have become a standard tool in functional
genomics. Once incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC), siRNAs mediate the specific recognition of corresponding
target mRNAs and their cleavage. However, only a small fraction of
randomly chosen siRNA sequences is able to induce efficient gene
silencing. In common laboratory practice, successful RNA interference
experiments typically require both, the labour and cost-intensive
identification of an active siRNA sequence and the optimization of
target cell line-specific procedures for optimal siRNA delivery.
To optimize the design and performance of siRNA experiments, we have
established the human siRNA database (HuSiDa). The database provides
sequences of published functional siRNA molecules targeting human
genes and important technical details of the corresponding gene silencing
experiments, including the mode of siRNA generation, recipient cell
lines, transfection reagents and procedures and direct links to published
references (PubMed). The database can be accessed at http://www.human-siRNA-database.net.
We used the siRNA sequence information stored in the database for
scrutinizing published sequence selection parameters for efficient

nucleotide substitutions or deletions in or near the targeted sequence.
We observed an inverse correlation between the level of resistance
and the stability of the siRNA/target-RNA duplex. However, two escape
variants showed a higher level of resistance than expected based
on the duplex stability. We demonstrate that these mutations induce
alternative folding of the RNA such that the target sequence is occluded
from binding to the siRNA, resulting in reduced RNAi efficiency.
HIV-1 can thus escape from RNAi-mediated inhibition not only through
nucleotide substitutions or deletions in the siRNA target sequence,
but also through mutations that alter the local RNA secondary structure.
The results highlight the enormous genetic flexibility of HIV-1 and
provide detailed molecular insight into the sequence specificity

Ribozyme efficacy depended on both ribozyme concentration and the

on data interpretation in the context of large-scale siRNA library
screen has not been reported. Here we report on off-target gene silencing
effects observed in a large-scale knockdown experiment designed to
identify novel regulators of the HIF-1 pathway. All of the three
'top hits' from our screen have been demonstrated to result from
off-target gene silencing. Two of the three 'siRNA hits' were found
to directly trigger down-regulation of hif-1alpha mRNA through a
7 nt motif, AGGCAGT, that is present in both the hif-1alpha mRNA

off-target gene silencing via this 7 nt motif depends on the characteristics
of the target mRNA, including the sequence context surrounding the
complementary region, the position of the complementary region in
the mRNA and the copy number of the complementary region. Interestingly,
the off-target siRNA against hif-1alpha was also shown to trigger
mRNA degradation with high probability of other genes that possess
multiple copies of the AGGCAGT motif in the 3'-untranslated region.
Lessons learned from this study will be a valuable asset to aid in

FITC did not reduce the effect on target mRNA. Mutations in the siRNAs
relative to target mRNA sequence gradually reduced, but did not abolish
mRNA depletion. Inactive siRNAs competed reversibly with active siRNAs
in a sequence-independent manner. Several lines of evidence suggest
the existence of a near equilibrium kinetic balance between mRNA
production and siRNA-mediated mRNA depletion. The silencing effect
was transient, with the level of mRNA recovering fully within 4-5
days, suggesting absence of a propagative system for RNAi in humans.
Finally, we observed 3' mRNA cleavage fragments resulting from the

was also tested in mutants that lacked Hfq or RNase III, or which
expressed a truncated RNase E (rne701). We found that translational
regulation by these sRNAs was largely independent of full-length
RNase E, e.g. despite the fact that ompA fusion mRNA decay could
no longer be promoted by MicA. This is the first study in which multiple
well-defined E.coli sRNA target pairs have been studied in a uniform
manner in vivo. We expect our GFP fusion approach to be applicable
to sRNA targets of other bacteria, and also demonstrate that Vibrio
RyhB sRNA represses a Vibrio sodB fusion when co-expressed in E.coli.},

developed nucleic acid folding software package, via the World Wide
Web (WWW). The software is based on a new statistical sampling paradigm
for the prediction of RNA secondary structure. One of the main objectives
of this software is to offer computational tools for the rational
design of RNA-targeting nucleic acids, which include small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs), antisense oligonucleotides and trans-cleaving ribozymes
for gene knock-down studies. The methodology for siRNA design is
based on a combination of RNA target accessibility prediction, siRNA
duplex thermodynamic properties and empirical design rules. Our approach
to target accessibility evaluation is an original extension of the
underlying RNA folding algorithm to account for the likely existence
of a population of structures for the target mRNA. In addition to
the application modules Sirna, Soligo and Sribo for siRNAs, antisense
oligos and ribozymes, respectively, the module Srna offers comprehensive
features for statistical representation of sampled structures. Detailed
output in both graphical and text formats is available for all modules.

We used zebrafish embryos as a vertebrate in vivo system to study substrate requirements for function of let-7. Injection of a double-stranded let-7 miRNA into the zygotes of zebrafish and frogs causes specific phenotypic defects. Only the antisense strand of the let-7 duplex has biological activity. In addition, co-injected mRNA of gfp fused to the 3'-UTR of a zebrafish lin-41 ortholog (a presumed target of let-7) is silenced by let-7. Point mutant studies revealed that the two let-7 target sites in the lin-41 3'-UTR are both essential and sufficient for silencing. let-7 and mir221 together, but not either of them alone, can silence a construct with one of the let-7 target sites replaced by a target site for mir221, showing that two different miRNAs can provide the required cooperative effect. let-7 target sites can be moved around: they are also functional when positioned in the coding sequence or even in the 5'-UTR of gfp. We took advantage of reporter and phenotypic assays to analyze the activity of all possible point mutant derivatives of let-7 and found that only the 5' region is critical for function of let-7.},

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for inhibiting the expression
of a gene by mediating the degradation of the corresponding mRNA.
The basis of this gene-specific inhibition is small, double-stranded
RNAs (dsRNAs), also referred to as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs),
that correspond in sequence to a part of the exon sequence of a silenced
gene. The selection of siRNAs for a target gene is a crucial step
in siRNA-mediated gene silencing. According to present knowledge,
siRNAs must fulfill certain properties including sequence length,
GC-content and nucleotide composition. Furthermore, the cross-silencing
capability of dsRNAs for other genes must be evaluated. When designing
siRNAs for chemical synthesis, most of these criteria are achievable
by simple sequence analysis of target mRNAs, and the specificity
can be evaluated by a single BLAST search against the transcriptome
of the studied organism. A different method for raising siRNAs has,
however, emerged which uses enzymatic digestion to hydrolyze long
pieces of dsRNA into shorter molecules. These endoribonuclease-prepared
siRNAs (esiRNAs or 'diced' RNAs) are less variable in their silencing
capabilities and circumvent the laborious process of sequence selection
for RNAi due to a broader range of products. Though powerful, this
method might be more susceptible to cross-silencing genes other than
the target itself. We have developed a web-based tool that facilitates
the design and quality control of siRNAs for RNAi. The program, DEQOR,
uses a scoring system based on state-of-the-art parameters for siRNA
design to evaluate the inhibitory potency of siRNAs. DEQOR, therefore,
can help to predict (i) regions in a gene that show high silencing
capacity based on the base pair composition and (ii) siRNAs with
high silencing potential for chemical synthesis. In addition, each
siRNA arising from the input query is evaluated for possible cross-silencing
activities by performing BLAST searches against the transcriptome
or genome of a selected organism. DEQOR can therefore predict the
probability that an mRNA fragment will cross-react with other genes
in the cell and helps researchers to design experiments to test the
specificity of esiRNAs or chemically designed siRNAs. DEQOR is freely
available at http://cluster-1.mpi-cbg.de/Deqor/deqor.html.},

abstract = {In several groups of bacterial plasmids, antisense RNAs regulate copy number through inhibition of replication initiator protein synthesis. These RNAs are characterized by a long hairpin structure interrupted by several unpaired residues or bulged loops. In plasmid R1, the inhibitory complex between the antisense RNA (CopA) and its target mRNA (CopT) is characterized by a four-way junction structure and a side-by-side helical alignment. This topology facilitates the formation of a stabilizer intermolecular helix between distal regions of both RNAs, essential for in vivo control. The bulged residues in CopA/CopT were shown to be required for high in vitro binding rate and in vivo activity. This study addresses the question of why removal of bulged nucleotides blocks stable complex formation. Structure mapping, modification interference, and molecular modeling of bulged-less mutant CopA-CopT complexes suggests that, subsequent to loop-loop contact, helix propagation is prevented. Instead, a fully base paired loop-loop interaction is formed, inducing a continuous stacking of three helices. Consequently, the stabilizer helix cannot be formed, and stable complex formation is blocked. In contrast to the four-way junction topology, the loop-loop interaction alone failed to prevent ribosome binding at its loading site and, thus, inhibition of RepA translation was alleviated.},

practically wild-type activity in a siRNA duplex. Finally, we find
that maximum depletion of target mRNA expression occurs significantly

Although it is widely accepted that sRNAs are encoded by most if not all bacteria, genome-wide annotations for sRNA-encoding genes have been conducted in only a few of the nearly 300 bacterial species sequenced to date. To facilitate the efficient annotation of bacterial genomes for sRNA-encoding genes, we developed a program, sRNAPredict2, that identifies putative sRNAs by searching for co-localization of genetic features commonly associated with sRNA-encoding genes. Using sRNAPredict2, we conducted genome-wide annotations for putative sRNA-encoding genes in the intergenic regions of 11 diverse pathogens. In total, 2759 previously unannotated candidate sRNA loci were predicted. There was considerable range in the number of sRNAs predicted in the different pathogens analyzed, raising the possibility that there are species-specific differences in the reliance on sRNA-mediated regulation. Of 34 previously unannotated sRNAs predicted in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 31 were experimentally tested and 17 were found to encode sRNA transcripts. Our findings suggest that numerous genes have been missed in the current annotations of bacterial genomes and that, by using improved bioinformatic approaches and tools, much remains to be discovered in 'intergenic' sequences.},

abstract = {Hfq protein is vital for the function of many non-coding small (s)RNAs
in bacteria but the mechanism by which Hfq facilitates the function
of sRNA is still debated. We developed a fluorescence resonance energy
transfer assay to probe how Hfq modulates the interaction between
a sRNA, DsrA, and its regulatory target mRNA, rpoS. The relevant
RNA fragments were labelled so that changes in intra- and intermolecular
RNA structures can be monitored in real time. Our data show that
Hfq promotes the strand exchange reaction in which the internal structure
of rpoS is replaced by pairing with DsrA such that the Shine-Dalgarno
sequence of the mRNA becomes exposed. Hfq appears to carry out strand
exchange by inducing rapid association of DsrA and a premelted rpoS
and by aiding in the slow disruption of the rpoS secondary structure.
Unexpectedly, Hfq also disrupts a preformed complex between rpoS
and DsrA. While it may not be a frequent event in vivo, this melting
activity may have implications in the reversal of sRNA-based regulation.
Overall, our data suggests that Hfq not only promotes strand exchange
by binding rapidly to both DsrA and rpoS but also possesses RNA chaperoning
properties that facilitates dynamic RNA-RNA interactions.},

However, some non-white-rot fungi, mainly belonging to the Ascomycota and Zygomycota phylum, have demonstrated their potential in the enzymatic transformation of environmental pollutants, thus overcoming some of the limitations observed in white-rot fungi with respect to growth in neutral pH, resistance to adverse conditions and the capacity to surpass autochthonous microorganisms. Despite their presence in so many soil and water environments, little information exists on the enzymatic mechanisms and degradation pathways involved in the transformation of hydrocarbons by these fungi.

abstract = {Bacterial small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) generally recognize target mRNAs in the 5' region to prevent 30S ribosomes from initiating translation. It was thought that the mRNA coding sequence (CDS) was refractory to sRNA-mediated repression, because elongating 70S ribosomes have an efficient RNA helicase activity that prevents stable target pairing. We report that the Hfq-associated MicC sRNA silences Salmonella typhimurium ompD mRNA via a {\textless}or=12-bp RNA duplex within the CDS (codons 23-26) that is essential and sufficient for repression. MicC does not inhibit translational initiation at this downstream position but instead acts by accelerating RNase E-dependent ompD mRNA decay. We propose an alternative gene-silencing pathway within bacterial CDS wherein sRNAs repress targets by endonucleolytic mRNA destabilization rather than by the prototypical inhibition of translational initiation. The discovery of CDS targeting markedly expands the sequence space for sRNA target predictions in bacteria.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) suppress gene expression by inhibiting translation, promoting mRNA decay or both. Each miRNA may regulate hundreds of genes to control the cell's response to developmental and other environmental cues. The best way to understand the function of a miRNA is to identify the genes that it regulates. Target gene identification is challenging because miRNAs bind to their target mRNAs by partial complementarity over a short sequence, suppression of an individual target gene is often small, and the rules of targeting are not completely understood. Here we review computational and experimental approaches to the identification of miRNA-regulated genes. The examination of changes in gene expression that occur when miRNA expression is altered and biochemical isolation of miRNA-associated transcripts complement target prediction algorithms. Bioinformatic analysis of over-represented pathways and nodes in protein-DNA interactomes formed from experimental candidate miRNA gene target lists can focus attention on biologically significant target genes.},

Here we show that Trim24 and Trim33 cooperatively repress retinoic acid receptor-dependent activity of VL30-class endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in liver. In Trim24-knockout hepatocytes, VL30 derepression leads to accumulation of reverse-transcribed VL30 cDNA in the cytoplasm that correlates with activation of the viral-defense interferon responses mimicking the preneoplastic inflammatory state seen in human liver following exogenous viral infection. Furthermore, upon derepression, VL30 long terminal repeats (LTRs) act as promoter and enhancer elements deregulating expression of neighboring genes and generating enhancer RNAs that are required for LTR enhancer activity in hepatocytes in vivo. These data reinforce the role of the TRIM family of proteins in retroviral restriction and antiviral defense and provide an example of an ERV-derived oncogenic regulatory network.},

Many genes encoding heat shock proteins and virulence factors are regulated by temperature-sensing RNA sequences, known as RNA thermometers (RNATs), in their mRNAs. For these genes, the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA folds into a structure that blocks ribosome access at low temperatures. Increasing the temperature gradually shifts the equilibrium between the closed and open conformations towards the open structure in a zipper-like manner, thereby increasing the efficiency of translation initiation. Here, we review the known molecular principles of RNAT action and the hierarchical RNAT cascade in Escherichia coli. We also discuss RNA-based thermosensors located upstream of cold shock and other genes, translation of which preferentially occurs at low temperatures and which thus operate through a different, more switch-like mechanism. Finally, we consider the potential biotechnological applications of natural and synthetic RNATs.},

However, rapid acceptance of the use of siRNAs has been accompanied by recognition of several hurdles for the technology, including a lack of specificity.

The RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease from the microbial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) adaptive immune system can be used to facilitate efficient genome engineering in eukaryotic cells by simply specifying a 20-nt targeting sequence within its guide RNA. Here we describe a set of tools for Cas9-mediated genome editing via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) in mammalian cells, as well as generation of modified cell lines for downstream functional studies. To minimize off-target cleavage, we further describe a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity. Beginning with target design, gene modifications can be achieved within as little as 1-2 weeks, and modified clonal cell lines can be derived within 2-3 weeks.},

In this method, enzymatic footprinting is coupled to high-throughput sequencing to provide secondary structure data for thousands of RNAs simultaneously. The entire experimental protocol takes ∼5 d to complete, and sequencing and data analysis take an additional 6-8 d. PARS was developed using the yeast genome as proof of principle, but its approach should be applicable to probing RNA structures from different transcriptomes and structural dynamics under diverse solution conditions.},

The approach applies to known transcription factors, whose binding specificity is represented by position-specific scoring matrices, using the program matrix-scan. The detection of individual binding sites is known to return many false predictions. However, results can be strongly improved by estimating P value, and by searching for combinations of sites (homotypic and heterotypic models). We illustrate the detection of sites and enriched regions with a study case, the upstream sequence of the Drosophila melanogaster gene even-skipped. This protocol is also tested on random control sequences to evaluate the reliability of the predictions. Each task requires a few minutes of computation time on the server. The complete protocol can be executed in about one hour.},

In recent years, owing to the emergence of new sequencing technologies such as RNA-seq and dramatic improvements in the depth and throughput of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the pace of proteogenomic research has greatly accelerated. Here I review the current state of proteogenomic methods and applications, including computational strategies for building and using customized protein sequence databases. I also draw attention to the challenge of false positive identifications in proteogenomics and provide guidelines for analyzing the data and reporting the results of proteogenomic studies.},

We demonstrate by independent experimental downstream analyses such as genetic interaction, as well as polysomal profiling and luciferase assays, that validation by targeted proteomics substantially enriched for biologically relevant let-7 interactors. For example, we found that the zinc finger protein ZTF-7 was a bona fide let-7 miRNA target. We also validated predicted miR-58 targets, demonstrating that this approach is adaptable to other miRNAs. We propose that targeted mass spectrometry can be applied generally to validate candidate lists generated by computational methods or in large-scale experiments, and that the described strategy should be readily adaptable to other organisms.},

Our data indicate that the duck possesses a contractive immune gene repertoire, as in chicken and zebra finch, and this repertoire has been shaped through lineage-specific duplications. We identify genes that are responsive to influenza A viruses using the lung transcriptomes of control ducks and ones that were infected with either a highly pathogenic (A/duck/Hubei/49/05) or a weakly pathogenic (A/goose/Hubei/65/05) H5N1 virus. Further, we show how the duck's defense mechanisms against influenza infection have been optimized through the diversification of its $\beta$-defensin and butyrophilin-like repertoires. These analyses, in combination with the genomic and transcriptomic data, provide a resource for characterizing the interaction between host and influenza viruses.},

abstract = {Structural and insertion-deletion (indel) variants have received considerable recent attention, partly because of their phenotypic consequences. Among these variants, the most common are small indels ( approximately 1-30 bp). Identifying and genotyping indels using sequence traces obtained from diploid samples requires extensive manual review, which makes large-scale studies inconvenient. We report a new algorithm, implemented in available software (PolyPhred version 6.0), to help automate detection and genotyping of indels from sequence traces. The algorithm identifies heterozygous individuals, which permits the discovery of low-frequency indels. It finds 80{\%} of all indel polymorphisms with almost no false positives and finds 97{\%} with a false discovery rate of 10{\%}. Additionally, genotyping accuracy exceeds 99{\%}, and it correctly infers indel length in 96{\%} of the cases.

abstract = {The detection of sequence variation, for which DNA sequencing has emerged as the most sensitive and automated approach, forms the basis of all genetic analysis. Here we describe and illustrate an algorithm that accurately detects and genotypes SNPs from fluorescence-based sequence data. Because the algorithm focuses particularly on detecting SNPs through the identification of heterozygous individuals, it is especially well suited to the detection of SNPs in diploid samples obtained after DNA amplification. It is substantially more accurate than existing approaches and, notably, provides a useful quantitative measure of its confidence in each potential SNP detected and in each genotype called. Calls assigned the highest confidence are sufficiently reliable to remove the need for manual review in several contexts. For example, for sequence data from 47-90 individuals sequenced on both the forward and reverse strands, the highest-confidence calls from our algorithm detected 93{\%} of all SNPs and 100{\%} of high-frequency SNPs, with no false positive SNPs identified and 99.9{\%} genotyping accuracy. This algorithm is implemented in a software package, PolyPhred version 5.0, which is freely available for academic use.},

Here we report the genome sequence of Oleispira antarctica and show that compared with Alcanivorax borkumensis--the paradigm of mesophilic hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria--O. antarctica has a larger genome that has witnessed massive gene-transfer events. We identify an array of alkane monooxygenases, osmoprotectants, siderophores and micronutrient-scavenging pathways. We also show that at low temperatures, the main protein-folding machine Cpn60 functions as a single heptameric barrel that uses larger proteins as substrates compared with the classical double-barrel structure observed at higher temperatures. With 11 protein crystal structures, we further report the largest set of structures from one psychrotolerant organism. The most common structural feature is an increased content of surface-exposed negatively charged residues compared to their mesophilic counterparts. Our findings are relevant in the context of microbial cold-adaptation mechanisms and the development of strategies for oil-spill mitigation in cold environments.},

Here, we present Scripture, a method to reconstruct the transcriptome of a mammalian cell using only RNA-Seq reads and the genome sequence. We applied it to mouse embryonic stem cells, neuronal precursor cells and lung fibroblasts to accurately reconstruct the full-length gene structures for most known expressed genes. We identified substantial variation in protein coding genes, including thousands of novel 5' start sites, 3' ends and internal coding exons. We then determined the gene structures of more than a thousand large intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) and antisense loci. Our results open the way to direct experimental manipulation of thousands of noncoding RNAs and demonstrate the power of ab initio reconstruction to render a comprehensive picture of mammalian transcriptomes.},

Because RNA represents the direct output of the genetic information encoded by genomes and a significant proportion of a cell's regulatory capabilities are focused on its synthesis, processing, transport, modification and translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for understanding genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs.

Current classifications assume that chytrids form an early-diverging clade within the kingdom Fungi and imply a single loss of the spore flagellum, leading to the diversification of terrestrial fungi. Here we develop phylogenetic hypotheses for Fungi using data from six gene regions and nearly 200 species. Our results indicate that there may have been at least four independent losses of the flagellum in the kingdom Fungi. These losses of swimming spores coincided with the evolution of new mechanisms of spore dispersal, such as aerial dispersal in mycelial groups and polar tube eversion in the microsporidia (unicellular forms that lack mitochondria). The enigmatic microsporidia seem to be derived from an endoparasitic chytrid ancestor similar to Rozella allomycis, on the earliest diverging branch of the fungal phylogenetic tree.},

The hemiascomycete yeasts, with their compact genomes, similar lifestyle and distinct sexual and physiological properties, provide a unique opportunity to explore such mechanisms. We present here the complete, assembled genome sequences of four yeast species, selected to represent a broad evolutionary range within a single eukaryotic phylum, that after analysis proved to be molecularly as diverse as the entire phylum of chordates. A total of approximately 24,200 novel genes were identified, the translation products of which were classified together with Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins into about 4,700 families, forming the basis for interspecific comparisons. Analysis of chromosome maps and genome redundancies reveal that the different yeast lineages have evolved through a marked interplay between several distinct molecular mechanisms, including tandem gene repeat formation, segmental duplication, a massive genome duplication and extensive gene loss.},

Sequence data are obtained by directly sensing the ions produced by template-directed DNA polymerase synthesis using all-natural nucleotides on this massively parallel semiconductor-sensing device or ion chip. The ion chip contains ion-sensitive, field-effect transistor-based sensors in perfect register with 1.2 million wells, which provide confinement and allow parallel, simultaneous detection of independent sequencing reactions. Use of the most widely used technology for constructing integrated circuits, the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, allows for low-cost, large-scale production and scaling of the device to higher densities and larger array sizes. We show the performance of the system by sequencing three bacterial genomes, its robustness and scalability by producing ion chips with up to 10 times as many sensors and sequencing a human genome.},

Here we show that a previously undefined microRNA termed lsy-6 controls this neuronal left/right asymmetry of chemosensory receptor expression. lsy-6 mutants that we retrieved from a genetic screen for defects in neuronal left/right asymmetry display a loss of the ASEL-specific chemoreceptor expression profile with a concomitant gain of the ASER-specific profile. A lsy-6 reporter gene construct is expressed in less than ten neurons including ASEL, but not ASER. lsy-6 exerts its effects on ASEL through repression of cog-1, an Nkx-type homeobox gene, which contains a lsy-6 complementary site in its 3' untranslated region and that has been shown to control ASE-specific chemoreceptor expression profiles. lsy-6 is the first microRNA to our knowledge with a role in neuronal patterning, providing new insights into left/right axis formation.},

abstract = {Small RNAs associate with Argonaute proteins and serve as sequence-specific
guides to regulate messenger RNA stability, protein synthesis, chromatin
organization and genome structure. In animals, Argonaute proteins
segregate into two subfamilies. The Argonaute subfamily acts in RNA
interference and in microRNA-mediated gene regulation using 21-22-nucleotide
RNAs as guides. The Piwi subfamily is involved in germline-specific
events such as germline stem cell maintenance and meiosis. However,
neither the biochemical function of Piwi proteins nor the nature
of their small RNA guides is known. Here we show that MIWI, a murine
Piwi protein, binds a previously uncharacterized class of approximately
29-30-nucleotide RNAs that are highly abundant in testes. We have
therefore named these Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). piRNAs show
distinctive localization patterns in the genome, being predominantly
grouped into 20-90-kilobase clusters, wherein long stretches of small
RNAs are derived from only one strand. Similar piRNAs are also found
in human and rat, with major clusters occurring in syntenic locations.
Although their function must still be resolved, the abundance of
piRNAs in germline cells and the male sterility of Miwi mutants suggest
a role in gametogenesis.},

regulate gene expression in plants and animals. To investigate the
influence of miRNAs on transcript levels, we transfected miRNAs into
human cells and used microarrays to examine changes in the messenger
RNA profile. Here we show that delivering miR-124 causes the expression
profile to shift towards that of brain, the organ in which miR-124
is preferentially expressed, whereas delivering miR-1 shifts the
profile towards that of muscle, where miR-1 is preferentially expressed.
In each case, about 100 messages were downregulated after 12 h. The
3' untranslated regions of these messages had a significant propensity
to pair to the 5' region of the miRNA, as expected if many of these
messages are the direct targets of the miRNAs. Our results suggest
that metazoan miRNAs can reduce the levels of many of their target
transcripts, not just the amount of protein deriving from these transcripts.
Moreover, miR-1 and miR-124, and presumably other tissue-specific
miRNAs, seem to downregulate a far greater number of targets than
previously appreciated, thereby helping to define tissue-specific
gene expression in humans.},

Initial cleavage is catalysed by Drosha, a nuclease of the RNase III family, which acts on primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) in the nucleus. Here we show that Drosha exists in a multiprotein complex, the Microprocessor, and begin the process of deconstructing that complex into its constituent components. Along with Drosha, the Microprocessor also contains Pasha (partner of Drosha), a double-stranded RNA binding protein. Suppression of Pasha expression in Drosophila cells or Caenorhabditis elegans interferes with pri-miRNA processing, leading to an accumulation of pri-miRNAs and a reduction in mature miRNAs. Finally, depletion or mutation of pash-1 in C. elegans causes de-repression of a let-7 reporter and the appearance of phenotypic defects overlapping those observed upon examination of worms with lesions in Dicer (dcr-1) or Drosha (drsh-1). Considered together, these results indicate a role for Pasha in miRNA maturation and miRNA-mediated gene regulation.},

two Piwi members--MILI and MIWI--are essential for spermatogenesis
in mouse. Here we describe a new class of small RNAs that bind to

these small RNAs reveals a limited number of clusters, suggesting
that these RNAs are processed from long primary transcripts. The
small RNAs are 26-31 nucleotides (nt) in length--clearly distinct
from the 21-23 nt of microRNAs (miRNAs) or short interfering RNAs
(siRNAs)--and we refer to them as 'Piwi-interacting RNAs' or piRNAs.
Orthologous human chromosomal regions also give rise to small RNAs

an important starting point to determine the molecular function of

The modern coelacanth looks remarkably similar to many of its ancient relatives, and its evolutionary proximity to our own fish ancestors provides a glimpse of the fish that first walked on land. Here we report the genome sequence of the African coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. Through a phylogenomic analysis, we conclude that the lungfish, and not the coelacanth, is the closest living relative of tetrapods. Coelacanth protein-coding genes are significantly more slowly evolving than those of tetrapods, unlike other genomic features. Analyses of changes in genes and regulatory elements during the vertebrate adaptation to land highlight genes involved in immunity, nitrogen excretion and the development of fins, tail, ear, eye, brain and olfaction. Functional assays of enhancers involved in the fin-to-limb transition and in the emergence of extra-embryonic tissues show the importance of the coelacanth genome as a blueprint for understanding tetrapod evolution.},

The species belongs to the order of Caryophylalles, is diploid with 2n = 18 chromosomes, has an estimated genome size of 714-758 megabases and shares an ancient genome triplication with other eudicot plants. Leafy beets have been cultivated since Roman times, but sugar beet is one of the most recently domesticated crops. It arose in the late eighteenth century when lines accumulating sugar in the storage root were selected from crosses made with chard and fodder beet. Here we present a reference genome sequence for sugar beet as the first non-rosid, non-asterid eudicot genome, advancing comparative genomics and phylogenetic reconstructions. The genome sequence comprises 567 megabases, of which 85{\%} could be assigned to chromosomes. The assembly covers a large proportion of the repetitive sequence content that was estimated to be 63{\%}. We predicted 27,421 protein-coding genes supported by transcript data and annotated them on the basis of sequence homology. Phylogenetic analyses provided evidence for the separation of Caryophyllales before the split of asterids and rosids, and revealed lineage-specific gene family expansions and losses. We sequenced spinach (Spinacia oleracea), another Caryophyllales species, and validated features that separate this clade from rosids and asterids. Intraspecific genomic variation was analysed based on the genome sequences of sea beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima; progenitor of all beet crops) and four additional sugar beet accessions. We identified seven million variant positions in the reference genome, and also large regions of low variability, indicating artificial selection. The sugar beet genome sequence enables the identification of genes affecting agronomically relevant traits, supports molecular breeding and maximizes the plant's potential in energy biotechnology.},

abstract = {RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.},

abstract = {RNA structure has critical roles in processes ranging from ligand sensing to the regulation of translation, polyadenylation and splicing. However, a lack of genome-wide in vivo RNA structural data has limited our understanding of how RNA structure regulates gene expression in living cells. Here we present a high-throughput, genome-wide in vivo RNA structure probing method, structure-seq, in which dimethyl sulphate methylation of unprotected adenines and cytosines is identified by next-generation sequencing. Application of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded the first in vivo genome-wide RNA structure map at nucleotide resolution for any organism, with quantitative structural information across more than 10,000 transcripts. Our analysis reveals a three-nucleotide periodic repeat pattern in the structure of coding regions, as well as a less-structured region immediately upstream of the start codon, and shows that these features are strongly correlated with translation efficiency. We also find patterns of strong and weak secondary structure at sites of alternative polyadenylation, as well as strong secondary structure at 5' splice sites that correlates with unspliced events. Notably, in vivo structures of messenger RNAs annotated for stress responses are poorly predicted in silico, whereas mRNA structures of genes related to cell function maintenance are well predicted. Global comparison of several structural features between these two categories shows that the mRNAs associated with stress responses tend to have more single-strandedness, longer maximal loop length and higher free energy per nucleotide, features that may allow these RNAs to undergo conformational changes in response to environmental conditions. Structure-seq allows the RNA structurome and its biological roles to be interrogated on a genome-wide scale and should be applicable to any organism.},

Regulation occurs through the interplay of two domains of the RNA:
an aptamer domain that responds to intracellular metabolite concentrations
and an expression platform that uses two mutually exclusive secondary
structures to direct a decision-making process. In Gram-positive
bacteria such as Bacillus species, riboswitches control the expression
of more than 2{\%} of all genes through their ability to respond to
a diverse set of metabolites including amino acids, nucleobases and
protein cofactors. Here we report the 2.9-angstroms resolution crystal
structure of an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-responsive riboswitch
from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis complexed with S-adenosylmethionine,
an RNA element that controls the expression of several genes involved
in sulphur and methionine metabolism. This RNA folds into a complex
three-dimensional architecture that recognizes almost every functional
group of the ligand through a combination of direct and indirect
readout mechanisms. Ligand binding induces the formation of a series
of tertiary interactions with one of the helices, serving as a communication
link between the aptamer and expression platform domains.},

in response to the presence of double-stranded (ds)RNAs. The RNase
III-like enzyme Dicer first cleaves dsRNA into 21-23-nucleotide small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In the effector step, the multimeric RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC) identifies messenger RNAs homologous to
the siRNAs and promotes their degradation. The Argonaute 2 protein
(Ago2) is a critical component of RISC. Both Argonaute and Dicer
family proteins contain a common PAZ domain whose function is unknown.
Here we present the three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance
structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Ago2 PAZ domain. This domain
adopts a nucleic-acid-binding fold that is stabilized by conserved
hydrophobic residues. The nucleic-acid-binding patch is located in
a cleft between the surface of a central beta-barrel and a conserved
module comprising strands beta3, beta4 and helix alpha3. Because
critical structural residues and the binding surface are conserved,
we suggest that PAZ domains in all members of the Argonaute and Dicer
families adopt a similar fold with nucleic-acid binding function,
and that this plays an important part in gene silencing.},

In parallel, we quantified mRNA levels using microarrays. Here we show that a single miRNA can repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression is typically relatively mild. A number of known features of the miRNA-binding site such as the seed sequence also govern repression of human protein synthesis, and we report additional target sequence characteristics. We demonstrate that, in addition to downregulating mRNA levels, miRNAs also directly repress translation of hundreds of genes. Finally, our data suggest that a miRNA can, by direct or indirect effects, tune protein synthesis from thousands of genes.},

shown to adopt an RNase H fold critical for the endonuclease cleavage
activity of RISC. Here we report the crystal structure of Archaeoglobus

the binding pocket for guide-strand 5'-end recognition and providing
insight into guide-strand-mediated messenger RNA target recognition.
The phosphorylated 5' end of the guide RNA is anchored within a highly
conserved basic pocket, supplemented by the carboxy-terminal carboxylate
and a bound divalent cation. The first nucleotide from the 5' end
of the guide RNA is unpaired and stacks over a conserved tyrosine
residue, whereas successive nucleotides form a four-base-pair RNA
duplex. Mutation of the corresponding amino acids that contact the
5' phosphate in human Ago2 resulted in attenuated mRNA cleavage activity.
Our structure of the Piwi-RNA complex, and that determined elsewhere,
provide direct support for the 5' region of the guide RNA serving
as a nucleation site for pairing with target mRNA and for a fixed

small RNAs of approximately 21-23 nucleotides in length for regulation
of target gene expression at multiple levels through partial sequence
complementarities. Combined with widespread genome sequencing, experimental
use of RNAi has the potential to interrogate systematically all genes
in a given organism with respect to a particular function. However,
owing to a tolerance for mismatches and gaps in base-pairing with
targets, small RNAs could have up to hundreds of potential target
sequences in a genome, and some small RNAs in mammalian systems have
been shown to affect the levels of many messenger RNAs besides their
intended targets. The use of long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in
Drosophila, where Dicer-mediated processing produces small RNAs inside
cells, has been thought to reduce the probability of such 'off-target
effects' (OTEs). Here we show, however, that OTEs mediated by short
homology stretches within long dsRNAs are prevalent in Drosophila.
We have performed a genome-wide RNAi screen for novel components
of Wingless (Wg) signal transduction in Drosophila S2R + cells, and
found few, if any, legitimate candidates. Rather, many of the top
candidates exert their effects on Wg response through OTEs on known
pathway components or through promiscuous OTEs produced by tandem
trinucleotide repeats present in many dsRNAs and genes. Genes containing
such repeats are over-represented in candidate lists from published
screens, suggesting that they represent a common class of false positives.
Our results suggest simple measures to improve the reliability of

was either strand individually. After injection into adult animals,
purified single strands had at most a modest effect, whereas double-stranded
mixtures caused potent and specific interference. The effects of
this interference were evident in both the injected animals and their

required per affected cell, arguing against stochiometric interference
with endogenous mRNA and suggesting that there could be a catalytic

Loss of let-7 gene activity causes reiteration of larval cell fates during the adult stage, whereas increased let-7 gene dosage causes precocious expression of adult fates during larval stages. let-7 encodes a temporally regulated 21-nucleotide RNA that is complementary to elements in the 3' untranslated regions of the heterochronic genes lin-14, lin-28, lin-41, lin-42 and daf-12, indicating that expression of these genes may be directly controlled by let-7. A reporter gene bearing the lin-41 3' untranslated region is temporally regulated in a let-7-dependent manner. A second regulatory RNA, lin-4, negatively regulates lin-14 and lin-28 through RNA-RNA interactions with their 3' untranslated regions.

Through genome sequencing and computer-assisted recognition of modular motifs of catalytic domains, one can now confidently identify most NRPS biosynthetic genes of a fungal strain. The biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for two of the most important classes of NRP fungal derived drugs, cyclosporine and the echinocandins, have been recently characterized by genomic sequencing and annotation. Complete biosynthetic gene clusters for the pneumocandins and echinocandins have been mapped at the genetic level and functionally characterized to some extent. Genomic sequencing of representative strains of most of the variants in the echinocandin family, including the wild-type of the three fungal strains employed for industrial-scale production of caspofungin, micafungin and anidulofungin, has enabled characterization of the basic architecture of the echinocandin NRPS pathways. A comparative analysis of how pathway genes cause variations in lipoinitiation, biosynthesis of the non-proteinogenic amino acids, amino acid substitutions, and hydroxylations and sulfonations of the core peptide and contribute to the molecular diversity of the family is presented. We also review new information on the natural functions of NRPs, the differences between fungal and bacterial NRPSs, and functional characterization of selected NRPS gene clusters. Continuing discovery of the new fungal nonribosomal peptides has contributed new structural diversity and potential insights into their biological functions among other natural peptides and peptaibiotics. We therefore provide an update on new peptides, depsipeptides and peptaibols discovered in the Fungi since 2009.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that repress protein synthesis
by binding to target messenger RNAs. We investigated the effect of
target secondary structure on the efficacy of repression by miRNAs.
Using structures predicted by the Sfold program, we model the interaction
between an miRNA and a target as a two-step hybridization reaction:
nucleation at an accessible target site followed by hybrid elongation
to disrupt local target secondary structure and form the complete
miRNA-target duplex. This model accurately accounts for the sensitivity
to repression by let-7 of various mutant forms of the Caenorhabditis
elegans lin-41 3' untranslated region and for other experimentally
tested miRNA-target interactions in C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster.
These findings indicate a potent effect of target structure on target
recognition by miRNAs and establish a structure-based framework for
genome-wide identification of animal miRNA targets.},

EZH2 colocalize to the siRNA-targeted RASSF1A promoter, implicating

mRNA decay are incompletely defined. In this study, we have used
two approaches to disrupt activities of deadenylating and/or decapping
enzymes to monitor effects on mRNA decay kinetics and trap decay
intermediates. Our results show that deadenylation is the key first
step that triggers decay of both wild-type stable and nonsense codon-containing
unstable beta-globin mRNAs in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts. PAN2 and
CCR4 are the major poly(A) nucleases active in cytoplasmic deadenylation
that have biphasic kinetics, with PAN2 initiating deadenylation followed
by CCR4-mediated poly(A) shortening. DCP2-mediated decapping takes
place after deadenylation and may serve as a backup mechanism for
triggering mRNA decay when initial deadenylation by PAN2 is compromised.
Our findings reveal a functional link between deadenylation and decapping
and help to define in vivo pathways for mammalian cytoplasmic mRNA
decay.},

abstract = {We describe the crystal structures of the RNA dimerization initiation
sites (DIS) of HIV-1 subtypes A and B. Both molecules adopt a hairpin
conformation, with loop sequences consisting of 272-AGGUGCACA-280
and 272-AAGCGCGCA-280, respectively. This includes a six-base self-complementary
stretch (underlined) that allows homodimerization through the formation
of a loop-loop, or 'kissing-loop', complex. The DISs for the two
sequences have identical conformations, and the two interacting hairpins
show a perfect coaxial alignment. The conserved purines, A272 and
R273, are stacked in a bulged-out conformation and symmetrically
join the upward and downward strands of each hairpin by crossing
the helix major groove. There is good agreement between these structures
and previous results from chemical probing in solution, as well as
with differences in magnesium dependence for dimerization. The overall
shape of the kissing-loop complex is very similar to that of the
previously determined subtype A DIS duplex form. Unexpectedly, the
purine R273 is the only base seen at a different position and is
responsible for the difference in topology between the two forms.
We propose that the transition from kissing-loop duplex could occur
by a recombination mechanism based on symmetrical chain cleavage
at R273 of each hairpin and subsequent cross-religation, rather than
by base-pair melting and subsequent reannealing.},

However, the particular microRNAs (miRNAs) involved are largely unknown. Here we identify specific miRNAs that function at synapses to control dendritic spine structure by performing a functional screen. One of the identified miRNAs, miR-138, is highly enriched in the brain, localized within dendrites and negatively regulates the size of dendritic spines in rat hippocampal neurons. miR-138 controls the expression of acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), an enzyme regulating the palmitoylation status of proteins that are known to function at the synapse, including the alpha(13) subunits of G proteins (Galpha(13)). RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of APT1 and the expression of membrane-localized Galpha(13) both suppress spine enlargement caused by inhibition of miR-138, suggesting that APT1-regulated depalmitoylation of Galpha(13) might be an important downstream event of miR-138 function. Our results uncover a previously unknown miRNA-dependent mechanism in neurons and demonstrate a previously unrecognized complexity of miRNA-dependent control of dendritic spine morphogenesis.},

gene silencing in animals and plants initiated by double-stranded
(ds) RNA that is homologous to the silenced gene. This technology
has usually involved injection or transfection of dsRNA in model
nonvertebrate organisms. The longer dsRNAs are processed into short
(19 25 nucleotides) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by a ribonucleotide
protein complex that includes an RNAse III related nuclease (Dicer),
a helicase family member, and possibly a kinase and an RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRP). In mammalian cells it is known that dsRNA
30 base pairs or longer can trigger interferon responses that are
intrinsically sequence-nonspecific, thus limiting the application
of RNAi as an experimental and therapeutic agent. Duplexes of 21-nucleotide
siRNAs with short 3' overhangs, however, can mediate RNAi in a sequence-specific
manner in cultured mammalian cells. One limitation in the use of
siRNA as a therapeutic reagent in vertebrate cells is that short,
highly defined RNAs need to be delivered to target cells--a feat
thus far only accomplished by the use of synthetic, duplex RNAs delivered
exogenously to cells. In this report, we describe a mammalian Pol
III promoter system capable of expressing functional double-stranded
siRNAs following transfection into human cells. In the case of the

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is the process of sequence-specific post-transcriptional
gene silencing triggered by double-stranded RNAs. In attempts to
identify RNAi triggers that effectively function at lower concentrations,
we found that synthetic RNA duplexes 25-30 nucleotides in length
can be up to 100-fold more potent than corresponding conventional
21-mer small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Some sites that are refractory
to silencing by 21-mer siRNAs can be effectively targeted by 27-mer
duplexes, with silencing lasting up to 10 d. Notably, the 27-mers
do not induce interferon or activate protein kinase R (PKR). The
enhanced potency of the longer duplexes is attributed to the fact
that they are substrates of the Dicer endonuclease, directly linking
the production of siRNAs to incorporation in the RNA-induced silencing
complex. These results provide an alternative strategy for eliciting
RNAi-mediated target cleavage using low concentrations of synthetic
RNA as substrates for cellular Dicer-mediated cleavage.},

monomers to 17-mers was fabricated on the surface of a glass plate

formation with rabbit beta-globin mRNA. The oligonucleotides were
complementary to the first 122 bases of mRNA comprising the 5' UTR
and bases 1 to 69 of the first exon. Surprisingly few oligonucleotides
gave significant heteroduplex yield. Antisense activity, measured
in a RNase H assay and by in vitro translation, correlated well with
yield of heteroduplex on the array. These results help to explain
the variable success that is commonly experienced in the choice of
antisense oligonucleotides. For the optimal ON, the concentration
required to inhibit translation by 50{\%} was found to be five times
less than for any other ON. We find no obvious features in the mRNA
sequence or the predicted secondary structure that can explain the
variation in heteroduplex yield. However, the arrays provide a simple
empirical method of selecting effective antisense oligonucleotides
for any RNA target of known sequence.},

Adhesion of fungal conidia, to host cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components associated with host tissue surfaces, is thought to be the primary step in the pathogenesis and dissemination of infection. To identify novel adhesion proteins (adhesins) of A. fumigatus, we screened its proteome in silico using SPAAN (software program for prediction of adhesins and adhesin-like proteins using neural networks). One of the predicted adhesin-encoding genes with a P(ad) (probability of being adhesin) value {\textgreater}0.9, the gene encoding extracellular thaumatin domain protein (AfCalA), was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant AfCalAp showed significant binding with laminin and murine lung cells. Anti-AfCalAp antibodies inhibited the binding of AfCalAp to laminin in a dose-dependent manner. Significant binding of anti-AfCalAp antibodies to 2 h swollen conidia suggests the presence of AfCalAp on the conidial surface. AfCalA transcript was not detectable in resting conidia but was detected in conidia incubated with RPMI 1640 medium in the presence and absence of lung epithelial cell line (A539)-derived ECM. Elevated levels of IgE antibodies specific to AfCalAp were observed in the sera of two out of seven patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The study confirms the relevance of the bioinformatic approach for predicting fungal adhesins and establishes AfCalAp as a novel laminin-binding protein of A. fumigatus.},

abstract = {Candida albicans is the most important cause of systemic fungal infection in immunocompromised humans. Candidiasis is often initiated by the adherence and the colonization of inert surfaces such as peripheral venous catheters, central catheters, prosthetic cardiac valves, and other prostheses. We have studied the early stage of adherence and have shown that the disruption of C. albicans IFF4 gene encoding a GPI-anchor protein, led to a decrease of adherence of the germ tubes to plastic. Here, we demonstrated the role of the IFF4 gene in adherence to silicone catheter, as well as in virulence using a murine model of disseminated candidiasis. The iff4 Delta null mutant showed both a decrease of adherence to silicone catheter and a reduction of virulence. This work presents evidence for the importance of the IFF4 gene in host-fungal interaction.},

abstract = {Black microcolonial fungi (MCF) and black yeasts are among the most stress-resistant eukaryotic organisms known on Earth. They mainly inhabit bare rock surfaces in hot and cold deserts of all regions of the Earth, but some of them have a close phylogenetic relation to human pathogenic black fungi which makes them important model organisms also with respect to clinical mycology. The environment of those fungi is especially characterized by extreme changes from humidity to long periods of desiccation and extreme temperature differences. A key to the understanding of MCF ecology is the question about metabolic activity versus dormancy in the natural environments. In this study, the time lag from the desiccated state to rehydration and full metabolic activity and growth was measured and defined in accordance with simulated environmental conditions. The ability to survive after desiccation and the speed of rehydration as well as changes of the whole cell protein pattern are demonstrated. Whereas both mesophilic strains--Exophiala jeanselmei and Knufia perforans (=Coniosporium perforans)--show a clear reaction toward desiccation by production of small proteins, Cryomyces antarcticus--the extremotolerant MCF--does not show any response to desiccation but seems just to down-regulate its metabolism. Data on intracellular sugar suggest that both trehalose and mannitol might play a cell protective role in those fungi.},

abstract = {Formation of tenacious and massive black biofilms was occasionally observed at the water-air interphase of water taps and in associated habitats at several locations in Germany. Exophiala lecanii-corni was proven to be the dominant component of these biofilms. Water utility companies were interested to understand by which route fungi building these black biofilms enter their habitat at affected sites in domestic sanitary. A wide variety of fungi is known to be common in wet indoor environments, as well as in the drinking water resources. Two possible routes of entry are therefore considered as follows: (a) distribution by the drinking water system or (b) a retrograde route of colonisation. Previous compositional analysis revealed that the black constituents of biofilms primarily belong to the herpotrichiellaceous black yeast and relatives. Therefore, a systematic search for black fungi in the drinking water system was performed using Sabouraud's glucose agar medium with chloramphenicol and erythritol-chloramphenicol agar as isolation media. Cadophora malorum was the dominant fungus in the investigated drinking water systems, and samples taken from the house connections (n = 50; 74 {\%}, {\textless}200 cfu/L), followed by a so far undescribed Alternaria sp. (28 {\%}; {\textless}10 cfu/L) and E. castellanii (26 {\%}; {\textless}10 cfu/L). Of note, C. malorum was not present in any previously analysed biofilm. Since E. lecanii-corni was not found in any water sample from the distribution system tested, but represented the most abundant species in dark biofilms previously analysed, a retrograde route of contamination in case of E. lecanii-corni can be assumed.},

abstract = {Mass growth of dark fungal biofilms on water taps and associated habitats was observed in various German drinking water distribution systems recently. Customers of affected drinking water systems are anxious about potential and unknown health risks. These environments are known to harbour a fungal flora also comprising a variety of fungal opportunists that are well known to cause superficial mycoses in humans (Exophiala equina, Exophiala lecanii-corni) but are not known to establish dark biofilms so far. To gain profound insight on composition of respective biofilms, a metagenomic approach using Tag-Encoded FLX Amplicon Pyrosequencing (TEFAP) of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 region in comparison with a classical cultivation approach using Sabouraud agar with chloramphenicol and erythritol-chloramphenicol-agar was performed. E. lecanii-corni was found to be the major component in 10 of 13 biofilms analysed independently of the method used. Alternaria sp., E. equina, Fusarium spp. and Ochroconis spp. were also relatively abundant. As expected, TEFAP usually revealed a higher diversity than the cultivation approaches. For example, opportunistic species like Candida albicans or Exophiala dermatitidis were detected in very low amounts. In conclusion, TEFAP turned out to be a promising and powerful tool for the semi-quantitative analysis of fungal biofilms. Referring to relevant literature, potential biological hazards caused by fungi of the dark biofilms can be regarded as low.},

Three different techniques were used: solid state-like batches, air biofilters and liquid cultures. Fungal growth in the latter systems was favoured by combining low pH and low water activity. Soil and groundwater samples from gasoline-polluted environments were used as inocula. The isolates were identified as deuteromycetes belonging to the genera Cladophialophora, Exophiala and Leptodontium and the ascomycete Pseudeurotium zonatum. The previously isolated toluene-degrading fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum was included in the present study. Results showed that fungi grew on toluene with doubling times of about 2 to 3 days. Some of the strains also grew on ethylbenzene and styrene. The apparent half-saturation constant (Km) for toluene oxidation ranged from 5 to 22 {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashmu{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}M. Degradation activity was inhibited by 50{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} at toluene concentrations ranging from 2.4 to 4.7 mM. These kinetic parameters are comparable to analogous data reported for toluene-degrading bacteria. The ability of fungi to grow at low water activities and low pH suggest that they may be used for the purification of gas streams containing aromatic hydrocarbons in air biofilters.},

Exuded droplets contained destruxin A, B and E in concentrations similar to those on submerged culture on Czapek Dox medium with equivalent C:N ratios but was clearly less than previously reported on standard Czapek Dox or Sabouraud dextrose broth. Destruxins also were found in agar samples from directly below mycelium and from up to 2 cm from the colony edge. Exudates retrieved from different media were proven to have Pr1 protease-related enzyme activity. Additional HPLC analysis indicated that droplets from diverse media did not differ in their sugar and acid content.

Our integrative analysis of transcriptome dynamics and protein-DNA interaction data sets showed widespread environment-dependent modulation of operon architectures, transcription initiation and termination inside coding sequences, and extensive overlap in 3' ends of transcripts for many convergently transcribed genes. A significant fraction of these alternate transcriptional events correlate to binding locations of 11 transcription factors and regulators (TFs) inside operons and annotated genes-events usually considered spurious or non-functional. Using experimental validation, we illustrate the prevalence of overlapping genomic signals in archaeal transcription, casting doubt on the general perception of rigid boundaries between coding sequences and regulatory elements.},

abstract = {RNA silencing plays a critical role in plant resistance against viruses, with multiple silencing factors participating in antiviral defense. Both RNA and DNA viruses are targeted by the small RNA-directed RNA degradation pathway, with DNA viruses being also targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation. To evade RNA silencing, plant viruses have evolved a variety of counter-defense mechanisms such as expressing RNA-silencing suppressors or adopting silencing-resistant RNA structures. This constant defense-counter defense arms race is likely to have played a major role in defining viral host specificity and in shaping viral and possibly host genomes. Recent studies have provided evidence that RNA silencing also plays a direct role in viral disease induction in plants, with viral RNA-silencing suppressors and viral siRNAs as potentially the dominant players in viral pathogenicity. However, questions remain as to whether RNA silencing is the principal mediator of viral pathogenicity or if other RNA-silencing-independent mechanisms also account for viral disease induction. RNA silencing has been exploited as a powerful tool for engineering virus resistance in plants as well as in animals. Further understanding of the role of RNA silencing in plant-virus interactions and viral symptom induction is likely to result in novel anti-viral strategies in both plants and animals.},

Virus-derived siRNAs inhibit viral replication in infected cells and potentially move to neighboring cells, immunizing them from incoming virus. Viruses have evolved various ways to evade and suppress siRNA production or action. Here we show that 21-, 22- and 24-nucleotide (nt) viral siRNAs together constitute up to 19{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of total small RNA population of Oryza sativa plants infected with Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and cover both strands of the RTBV DNA genome. However, viral siRNA hotspots are restricted to a short non-coding region between transcription and reverse transcription start sites. This region generates double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursor of siRNAs and, in pregenomic RNA, forms a stable secondary structure likely inaccessible to siRNA-directed cleavage. In transient assays, RTBV protein P4 suppressed cell-to-cell spread of silencing but enhanced cell-autonomous silencing, which correlated with reduced 21-nt siRNA levels and increased 22-nt siRNA levels. Our findings imply that RTBV generates decoy dsRNA that restricts siRNA production to the structured noncoding region and thereby protects other regions of the viral genome from repressive action of siRNAs, while the viral protein P4 interferes with cell-to-cell spread of antiviral silencing.},

A large cleavage and polyadenylation complex containing the major poly(A) polymerase Pap1 produces mRNA 3' ends, whereas those of nonpolyadenylated snoRNAs in yeast are formed either by endonucleolytic cleavage or by termination, followed by trimming by the nuclear exosome. We show that synthesis of independently transcribed snoRNAs involves default polyadenylation of two classes of precursors derived from termination at a main Nrd1/Nab3-dependent site or a "fail-safe" mRNA-like signal. Poly(A) tails are added by Pap1 to both forms, whereas the alternative poly(A) polymerase Tfr4 adenylates major precursors and processing intermediates to facilitate further polyadenylation by Pap1 and maturation by the exosome/Rrp6. A more important role of Trf4/TRAMP, however, is to enhance Nrd1 association with snoRNA genes. We propose a model in which polyadenylation of pre-snoRNAs is a key event linking their transcription termination, 3' end processing, and degradation.},

abstract = {Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) are important to eukaryotic gene expression. In the nucleus, the PABP PABPN1 is thought to function in polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs. Deletion of fission yeast pab2, the homolog of mammalian PABPN1, results in transcripts with markedly longer poly(A) tails, but the nature of the hyperadenylated transcripts and the mechanism that leads to RNA hyperadenylation remain unclear. Here we report that Pab2 functions in the synthesis of noncoding RNAs, contrary to the notion that PABPs function exclusively on protein-coding mRNAs. Accordingly, the absence of Pab2 leads to the accumulation of polyadenylated small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Our findings suggest that Pab2 promotes poly(A) tail trimming from pre-snoRNAs by recruiting the nuclear exosome. This work unveils a function for the nuclear PABP in snoRNA synthesis and provides insights into exosome recruitment to polyadenylated RNAs.},

abstract = {We describe the identification and characterization of circular intronic long noncoding RNAs in human cells, which accumulate owing to a failure in debranching. The formation of such circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs) can be recapitulated using expression vectors, and their processing depends on a consensus motif containing a 7 nt GU-rich element near the 5' splice site and an 11 nt C-rich element close to the branchpoint site. In addition, we show that ciRNAs are abundant in the nucleus and have little enrichment for microRNA target sites. Importantly, knockdown of ciRNAs led to the reduced expression of their parent genes. One abundant such RNA, ci-ankrd52, largely accumulates to its sites of transcription, associates with elongation Pol II machinery, and acts as a positive regulator of Pol II transcription. This study thus suggests a cis-regulatory role of noncoding intronic transcripts on their parent coding genes.},

The expression of ZmbZIP60 in Arabidopsis bzip60 mutant partially restored the induction of BiP3 transcription under TM treatment, which indicated that ZmbZIP60 may play a role in the signal transduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Overexpression of ZmbZIP60 in wild-type Arabidopsis displayed enhanced bolting trends when subjected to dithiothreitol stress. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some key genes in floral transition, including CO, FT, and AP1, were up- or down-regulated in ZmbZIP60-overexpressing plants, which may reveal the functional difference of ZmbZIP60 from AtbZIP60.},

abstract = {Current sequencing methods produce large amounts of data, but genome assemblies constructed from these data are often fragmented and incomplete. Incomplete and error-filled assemblies result in many annotation errors, especially in the number of genes present in a genome. This means that methods attempting to estimate rates of gene duplication and loss often will be misled by such errors and that rates of gene family evolution will be consistently overestimated. Here, we present a method that takes these errors into account, allowing one to accurately infer rates of gene gain and loss among genomes even with low assembly and annotation quality. The method is implemented in the newest version of the software package CAFE, along with several other novel features. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method with extensive simulations and reanalyze several previously published data sets. Our results show that errors in genome annotation do lead to higher inferred rates of gene gain and loss but that CAFE 3 sufficiently accounts for these errors to provide accurate estimates of important evolutionary parameters.},

abstract = {Ribosomal and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) comprise numerous modified nucleotides. The modification patterns are retained during evolution, making it even possible to project them from yeast onto human. The stringent conservation of modification sites and the slow evolution of rRNAs and snRNAs contradicts the rapid evolution of small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) sequences. To explain this discrepancy, we investigated the coevolution of snoRNAs and their targeted sites throughout vertebrates. To measure and evaluate the conservation of RNA-RNA interactions, we defined the interaction conservation index (ICI). It combines the quality of individual interaction with the scope of its conservation in a set of species and serves as an efficient measure to evaluate the conservation of the interaction of snoRNA and target. We show that functions of homologous snoRNAs are evolutionarily stable, thus, members of the same snoRNA family guide equivalent modifications. The conservation of snoRNA sequences is high at target binding regions while the remaining sequence varies significantly. In addition to elucidating principles of correlated evolution, we were able, with the help of the ICI measure, to assign functions to previously orphan snoRNAs and to associate snoRNAs as partners to known chemical modifications unassigned to a given snoRNA. Furthermore, we used predictions of snoRNA functions in conjunction with sequence conservation to identify distant homologies. Because of the high overall entropy of snoRNA sequences, such relationships are hard to detect by means of sequence homology search methods alone.},

We also demonstrate that U17/snR30 is present in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the unicellular ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. Evolutionary comparison revealed that the 3'-terminal hairpins of U17/snR30 snoRNAs contain two highly conserved sequence motifs, the m1 (AUAUUCCUA) and m2 (AAACCAU) elements. Mutation analysis of yeast snR30 demonstrated that the m1 and m2 elements are essential for early cleavages of the 35S pre-rRNA and, consequently, for the production of mature 18S rRNA. The m1 and m2 motifs occupy the opposite strands of an internal loop structure, and they are located invariantly 7 nucleotides upstream from the ACA box of U17/snR30 snoRNAs. U17/snR30 is the first identified box H/ACA snoRNA that possesses an evolutionarily conserved role in the nucleolytic processing of eukaryotic pre-rRNA.},

abstract = {Recent emergence of new mass spectrometry techniques (e.g. electron transfer dissociation, ETD) and improved availability of additional proteases (e.g. Lys-N) for protein digestion in high-throughput experiments raised the challenge of designing new algorithms for interpreting the resulting new types of tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra. Traditional MS/MS database search algorithms such as SEQUEST and Mascot were originally designed for collision induced dissociation (CID) of tryptic peptides and are largely based on expert knowledge about fragmentation of tryptic peptides (rather than machine learning techniques) to design CID-specific scoring functions. As a result, the performance of these algorithms is suboptimal for new mass spectrometry technologies or nontryptic peptides. We recently proposed the generating function approach (MS-GF) for CID spectra of tryptic peptides. In this study, we extend MS-GF to automatically derive scoring parameters from a set of annotated MS/MS spectra of any type (e.g. CID, ETD, etc.), and present a new database search tool MS-GFDB based on MS-GF. We show that MS-GFDB outperforms Mascot for ETD spectra or peptides digested with Lys-N. For example, in the case of ETD spectra, the number of tryptic and Lys-N peptides identified by MS-GFDB increased by a factor of 2.7 and 2.6 as compared with Mascot. Moreover, even following a decade of Mascot developments for analyzing CID spectra of tryptic peptides, MS-GFDB (that is not particularly tailored for CID spectra or tryptic peptides) resulted in 28{\%} increase over Mascot in the number of peptide identifications. Finally, we propose a statistical framework for analyzing multiple spectra from the same precursor (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs) and assigning p values to peptide-spectrum-spectrum matches.},

abstract = {Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can mediate sequence-specific inhibition
of gene expression in mammalian cells. We and others have recently
developed expression vector-based systems for synthesizing siRNAs
or hairpin siRNAs in mammalian cells. Expression vector-based RNA
interference (RNAi) effectively suppresses expression of target genes
and is likely to be a powerful tool for analysis of gene function.
Here we compare inhibition by vectors expressing hairpin siRNA designs
either with different loop sequences connecting the two siRNA strands,
or with duplex regions of different lengths. Our results suggest
that lengthening the 19-nucleotide duplex region of a relatively
ineffective hairpin siRNA can increase inhibition, but increasing
the length of an effective 19-nt hairpin siRNA does not increase
inhibition. We also demonstrate that hairpin siRNA vectors can be
used to inhibit two target genes simultaneously. We have targeted
glycogen synthase kinase-3alpha (GSK-3alpha) and GSK-3beta, two related
kinases involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes
and also implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases.
Inhibition of either GSK-3alpha or GSK-3beta by transfection of hairpin
siRNA vectors leads to elevated expression of the GSK-3 target beta-catenin,
whereas inhibition of both kinases further increases beta-catenin
expression. Our results suggest that vector-based siRNA inhibition
may be useful for dissecting the functional roles of GSK-3alpha and
GSK-3beta in somatic cells. The ability to inhibit two or more genes
simultaneously with hairpin siRNA expression vectors should facilitate
studies of gene function in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {The importance of post-transcriptional regulation by small non-coding RNAs has recently been recognized in both pro- and eukaryotes. Small RNAs (sRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by base pairing with the mRNA. Here we use dynamical simulations to characterize this regulation mode in comparison to transcriptional regulation mediated by protein-DNA interaction and to post-translational regulation achieved by protein-protein interaction. We show quantitatively that regulation by sRNA is advantageous when fast responses to external signals are needed, consistent with experimental data about its involvement in stress responses. Our analysis indicates that the half-life of the sRNA-mRNA complex and the ratio of their production rates determine the steady-state level of the target protein, suggesting that regulation by sRNA may provide fine-tuning of gene expression. We also describe the network of regulation by sRNA in Escherichia coli, and integrate it with the transcription regulation network, uncovering mixed regulatory circuits, such as mixed feed-forward loops. The integration of sRNAs in feed-forward loops provides tight repression, guaranteed by the combination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations.},

The resulting decrease in the synthesis of iron-using proteins is thought to spare iron in order to ensure its availability for iron-requiring proteins that are indispensable. Indeed, the expression of RyhB from a heterologous promoter activates the iron-sensing repressor Fur, which suggests an increase in the pool of free intracellular iron (iron-sparing). In accordance with these observations, we report here that RyhB expression increases the concentration of free intracellular iron, as shown by direct measurements of the metal in whole cells by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our data also suggest that iron-sparing originates from rapid uptake of extracellular iron and not from already internalized metal. Furthermore, RyhB is shown to be essential for normal bacterial growth and survival during iron starvation, which is consistent with previous data describing the function of the small RNA. Overall, our data demonstrate that, by regulating synthesis of nonessential iron-using proteins, the small RNA RyhB ensures that the iron is directed towards the iron-requiring enzymes that are indispensable.},

by at least two small RNAs, DsrA and RprA. DsrA disrupts an inhibitory
secondary structure in the rpoS leader mRNA by pairing with the upstream

demonstrate that RprA interacts with the same region of the RpoS
leader as DsrA. This is the first example of two different small
RNAs regulating a common target. Regulation of these RNAs differs.
DsrA synthesis is increased at low temperature. We find that RprA
synthesis is regulated by the RcsC/RcsB phosphorelay system, previously
found to regulate capsule synthesis and promoters of ftsZ and osmC.
An rcsB null mutation abolishes the basal level, whereas mutations
in rcsC that activate capsule synthesis also activate expression
of the rprA promoter. An essential site with similarity to other
RcsB-regulated promoters was defined in the rprA promoter. Activation
of the RcsC/RcsB system leads to increased RpoS synthesis, in an
RprA-dependent fashion. This work suggests a new signal for RpoS

Specific single nucleotide substitutions around the Shine-Dalgarno

mutations in SgrS restored it. A systematic mutational analysis of
both ptsG and SgrS RNAs revealed that six base pairs around SD sequence
of ptsG are particularly important for SgrS action. We also showed
in vitro that SgrS forms a stable duplex with the ptsG mRNA, and

The half-life of this transcript correlates inversely with the bacterial

sites for RNase E. Hfq binds to this region, is essential for controlling
the stability and has been suggested to directly regulate ompA mRNA
decay. Here we report that the 78 nucleotide SraD RNA, which is highly
conserved among Enterobacteriaceae, acts in destabilizing the ompA
transcript when rapidly grown cells enter the stationary phase of
growth. During this growth-stage the expression of SraD RNA becomes
strongly increased. The SraD-mediated decay of ompA mRNA depends
on Hfq and in vitro studies revealed that Hfq facilitates binding
of the regulatory RNA to the translational initiation region of the

the stability of the ompA mRNA in slowly growing cells. Our results

U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is found in the earliest form of the spliceosome detected by native gel electrophoresis, both in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in metazoan extracts. To examine the requirements for the formation of this early complex (band III) in yeast extracts, we cleaved the U2 snRNA by oligonucleotide-directed RNase H digestion. U2 snRNA depletion by this means inhibits both splicing and band III formation. Using this depleted extract, we were able to design a chase experiment which shows that a pre-mRNA substrate is committed to the spliceosome assembly pathway in the absence of functional U2 snRNP. Interactions occurring during the commitment step are highly resistant to the addition of an excess of unlabeled substrate and require little or no ATP. Sequence requirements for this commitment step have been analyzed by competition experiments with deletion mutants: both the 5' splice site consensus sequence and the branch point TACTAAC box sequence are necessary. These experiments strongly suggest that the initial assembly process requires a trans-acting factor(s) (RNA and/or proteins) that recognizes and stably binds to the two consensus sequences of the pre-mRNA prior to U2 snRNP binding.},

branch point. Because Caenorhabditis elegans introns lack both polypyrimidine
tract and branch point consensus sequences but have a very highly
conserved UUUUCAG/R consensus at their 3' splice sites, we hypothesized
that U2AF might serve to recognize this sequence and thus promote
intron recognition in C. elegans. Here we report the cloning of the
gene for the large subunit of U2AF, uaf-1. Three classes of cDNA
were identified. In the most abundant class the open reading frame
is similar to that for the U2AF65 from mammals and flies. The remaining
two classes result from an alternative splicing event in which an
exon containing an in-frame stop codon is inserted near the beginning
of the second RNA recognition motif. However, this alternative mRNA
is apparently not translated. Interestingly, the inserted exon contains
10 matches to the 3' splice site consensus. To determine whether
this feature is conserved, we sequenced uaf-1 from the related nematode
Caenorhabditis briggsae. It is composed of six exons, including an
alternatively spliced third exon interrupting the gene at the same
location as in C. elegans. uaf-1 is contained in an operon with the
rab-18 gene in both species. Although the alternative exons from
the two species are not highly conserved and would not encode related
polypeptides, the C. briggsae alternative exon has 18 matches to
the 3' splice site consensus. We hypothesize that the array of 3'
splice site-like sequences in the pre-mRNA and alternatively spliced
exon may have a regulatory role. The alternatively spliced RNA accumulates
at high levels following starvation, suggesting that this RNA may
represent an adaption for reducing U2AF65 levels when pre-mRNA levels

By combining computational and experimental approaches, we uncovered five general features of site context that boost site efficacy: AU-rich nucleotide composition near the site, proximity to sites for coexpressed miRNAs (which leads to cooperative action), proximity to residues pairing to miRNA nucleotides 13-16, positioning within the 3'UTR at least 15 nt from the stop codon, and positioning away from the center of long UTRs. A model combining these context determinants quantitatively predicts site performance both for exogenously added miRNAs and for endogenous miRNA-message interactions.

We further identify a number of human snoRNAs with microRNA (miRNA)-like processing signatures. We have, therefore, identified a class of small RNAs in human cells that originate from snoRNAs and can function like miRNAs.},

abstract = {Guide RNAs are encoded in maxicircle and minicircle DNA of trypanosome
mitochondria. They play a pivotal role in RNA editing, a process
during which the nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial RNAs is altered
by U-insertion and deletion. Guide RNAs vary in length from 35 to
78 nucleotides, which correlates with the variation in length of
the three functionally important regions of which they are composed:
(i) a 4-14 nucleotide 'anchor' sequence embedded in the 5' region,
which is complementary to a target sequence on the pre-edited RNA
downstream of an editing domain, (ii) a middle part containing the
editing information, which ranges from guiding the insertion of just
one U into one site to that of the insertion of 32 Us into 10 sites,
and (iii) a 5-24 nucleotide 3' terminal oligo [U] extension. Moreover,
a variable uridylation site creates gRNAs containing a varying segment
of editing information for the same domain. Comparison of different
guide RNAs demonstrates that, besides the U-tail, they have no obvious
common primary and secondary sequence motifs, each particular sequence
being unique. The occurrence in vivo and the synthesis in vitro of
chimeric molecules, in which a guide RNA is covalently linked through
its 3' U-tail to an editing site of a pre-edited RNA, suggests that
RNA editing occurs by consecutive transesterification reactions and
is evidence that the guide RNAs not only provide the genetic information,
but also the Us themselves.},

abstract = {Azole resistance in Candida albicans can be mediated by several resistance mechanisms. Among these, alterations of the azole target enzyme and the overexpression of multidrug efflux transporter genes are the most frequent. To identify additional putative azole resistance genes in C. albicans, a genomic library from this organism was screened for complementation of fluconazole hypersusceptibility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae YKKB-13 lacking the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter gene PDR5. Among the C. albicans genes obtained, a new gene was isolated and named FLU1 (fluconazole resistance). The deduced amino acid sequence of FLU1 showed similarity to CaMDR1 (formerly BEN(r)), a member of the major facilitator superfamily of multidrug efflux transporters. The expression of FLU1 in YKKB-13 mediated not only resistance to fluconazole but also to cycloheximide among the different drugs tested. The disruption of FLU1 in C. albicans had only a slight effect on fluconazole susceptibility; however, it resulted in hypersusceptibility to mycophenolic acid, thus suggesting that this compound could be a substrate for the protein encoded by FLU1. Disruption of FLU1 in a background of C. albicans mutants with deletions in several multidrug efflux transporter genes, including CDR1, CDR2 and CaMDR1, resulted in enhanced susceptibility to several azole derivatives. FLU1 expression did not vary significantly between several pairs of azole-susceptible and azole-resistant C. albicans clinical isolates. Therefore, FLU1 seems not to be required for the development of azole resistance in clinical isolates.},

Transcriptional profiling of Deltadoa1 indicated that several genes associated with Ub-mediated proteolysis, including CDC48 and UBI4, are upregulated. These data suggest that DOA1 of C. albicans, like its orthologue in S. cerevisiae, is associated with Ub-mediated proteolysis and has multiple functions.

abstract = {The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) component Vma7p of the human-pathogenic yeast Candida albicans regulates hyphal growth induced by serum and Spider medium and is essential for virulence. In order to characterize the functions of the putative V-ATPase subunit Vma7p of C. albicans, null mutants were generated. The resulting mutants showed reduced vacuole acidification, which correlated with defective growth at alkaline pH. In addition, defects in degradation of intravacuolar putative endosomal structures were observed. vma7 null mutants were sensitive towards the presence of metal ions. It is concluded that the sequestration of toxic ions in the vacuole via a H+ gradient generated by the V-ATPase is affected. The vma7 null mutant strains were avirulent in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. In addition, C. albicans vma7 null mutants and the null mutant strain of the Vma7p-interacting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34p showed similar phenotypes. In summary, the V-ATPase subunit Vma7p is involved in vacuolar ion transport and this transport is required for hyphal growth and virulence of C. albicans.},

abstract = {The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis frequently encounters a reduction in temperature in its natural habitats. Here, a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach has been used to analyse the adaptational responses of B. subtilis to low temperature. Propagation of B. subtilis in minimal medium at 15 degrees C triggered the induction of 279 genes and the repression of 301 genes in comparison to cells grown at 37 degrees C. The analysis thus revealed profound adjustments in the overall gene expression profile in chill-adapted cells. Important transcriptional changes in low-temperature-grown cells comprise the induction of the SigB-controlled general stress regulon, the induction of parts of the early sporulation regulons (SigF, SigE and SigG) and the induction of a regulatory circuit (RapA/PhrA and Opp) that is involved in the fine-tuning of the phosphorylation status of the Spo0A response regulator. The analysis of chill-stress-repressed genes revealed reductions in major catabolic (glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthesis) and anabolic routes (biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, haem and fatty acids) that likely reflect the slower growth rates at low temperature. Low-temperature repression of part of the SigW regulon and of many genes with predicted functions in chemotaxis and motility was also noted. The proteome analysis of chill-adapted cells indicates a major contribution of post-transcriptional regulation phenomena in adaptation to low temperature. Comparative analysis of the previously reported transcriptional responses of cold-shocked B. subtilis cells with this data revealed that cold shock and growth in the cold constitute physiologically distinct phases of the adaptation of B. subtilis to low temperature.},

For this purpose two in vitro reconstructed tissue models were developed. A multi-layered model of human epidermis was used to simulate superficial infections of the skin, whereas a reconstructed human intestinal model was used to mimic the first steps of systemic infections. It was shown that C. albicans deleted for both transcription factors CPH1 and EFG1, in contrast to the congenic clinical isolate Sc5314, was neither able to adhere to, nor to penetrate, either of the model systems. A strain deleted for EFG1 alone showed significant reduction in adhesion and was not able to penetrate through the stratum corneum. However, strains deleted for CPH1 showed phenotypes paralleling the phenotypes of the clinical isolate Sc5314. Using different types of multi-layered human tissues reconstructed in vitro the individual contributions of Efg1p and Cph1p to two important virulence factors of C. albicans, namely adhesion and invasion, could be defined.

abstract = {Various factors are thought to be responsible for Candida albicans virulence, such as lipases, proteases and adhesins. Many of these factors are GPI-anchored cell surface proteins responsible for pathogenicity. Hwp2 is a putative GPI-anchored protein. The purpose of this study is to characterize the role of Hwp2 regarding filamentation on various filamentation-inducing and non-inducing solid and liquid media, virulence in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis, and drug resistance to six widely used antifungal agents, by creating a homozygous null hwp2 strain and comparing it with the parental and a revertant HWP2(+)strain. It was observed that an hwp2Delta strain was highly filamentation-deficient on solid agar media as opposed to most liquid media tested. Furthermore, the mutant strain was slightly reduced in virulence compared to the wild strain since all mice infected with the control strain died after 6 days of injection compared with 11 days for the mutant. These results indicate a possible role for Hwp2 in adhesion and invasiveness. Finally a previously unidentified 37-amino-acid-long, stretch of Hwp2, possibly involved in protein aggregation, was found to align with high sequence identity and exclusively to C. albicans cell wall proteins.},

Using an in vivo expression technology (IVET) we found a high percentage of expression of SAP4-6 genes which increased steadily in the course of infection. Expression of SAP1-3 genes was detected occasionally and in lower percentages than that of SAP4-6 genes. With reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), mRNA for SAP 4 and SAP6 were detected in the stomach of all mice, whereas SAP2, SAP3 and SAP5 mRNA were detected not in all animals and SAP1 mRNA was not detectable. Also with immunoelectron microscopy we demonstrated production of Saps1-3 as well as Saps4-6 with antibodies cross-reacting with either Saps1-3 or Saps4-6. In contrast to the fact that gene expression and production of Saps were readily detectable, we were unable to demonstrate differences in the ability to invade the stomach, to disseminate to the brain as well as in the duration of faecal shedding and the number of fungi persisting in the faeces of mice infected with SAP knockout strains in comparison to control strains. We conclude that although Saps were produced, individual Saps were not indispensable factors for virulence during gastrointestinal infection of mice.},

One of the hallmarks of Brucella infection is its capacity to establish a chronic infection, characteristic that depends on a wide repertoire of virulence factors among which are immunomodulatory proteins such as PrpA (encoding the proline racemase protein A or hydroxyproline-2-epimerase), involved in the establishment of the chronic phase of the infectious process that we have previously identified and characterized. We report here that, in vivo, Brucella abortus prpA is responsible for an increment in the B-cell number and in the specific antibody response and that these antibodies promote cell infection. We additionally found that Brucella alters the cytokine levels of IFN-$\gamma$, IL-10, TGF$\beta$1 and TNF$\alpha$ during the acute phase of the infectious process in a prpA dependent manner.},

abstract = {Lichens are frequently colonized by specialized, lichenicolous fungi. Symptomatic lichenicolous fungi usually display typical phenotypes and reproductive structures on the lichen hosts. The classification based on these structures revealed different host specificity patterns. Other fungi occur asymptomatically in the lichen thalli and are much less known. We aimed at studying the diversity of lichen-associated fungi in specific, lichen-rich communities on rocks in the Alps. We tested whether lichenicolous fungi developing symptomatically on their known hosts also occur asymptomatically in other thalli of the same or of different host species. We collected lichen thalli according to a uniform sampling design comprising individuals adjacent to thalli that showed symptoms of lichenicolous fungal infections. The total fungal communities in the selected lichen thalli were further studied by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) fingerprinting analyses and sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) fragments. The systematic, stratified sampling strategy helped to recover 17 previously undocumented lichenicolous fungi and almost exhaustively the species diversity of symptomatic lichenicolous fungi in the studied region. The results from SSCP and the sequencing analyses did not reveal asymptomatic occurrence of normally symptomatic lichenicolous fungi in thalli of both the same and different lichen host species. The fungal diversity did not correlate with the species diversity of the symptomatic lichenicolous fungus-lichen host associations. The complex fingerprint patterns recovered here for fungal communities, in associations of well-delimited lichen thalli, suggest lichen symbiosis as suitable subjects for fungal metacommunity studies.},

abstract = {The yeast community associated with deep-sea hydrothermal systems of the Mid-Atlantic Rift was surveyed for the first time. This study relied on a culture-based approach using two different growth media: a conventional culture medium for yeasts supplemented with sea salts (MYPss) and the same medium additionally supplemented with sulfur (MYPssS). For the evaluation of species diversity, a molecular approach involving minisatellite-primed polymerase chain reaction (MSP-PCR) strain typing and sequence analysis of the D1/D2 domains of the 26S rDNA was followed. In the seven water samples that were studied, the number of colony-forming units per liter (cfu/L) ranged from 0 to 5940. The nonpigmented yeasts were much more abundant than the pink-pigmented ones. This disproportion was not observed in studies of other marine systems and may be due to the unique conditions of hydrothermal vents, characterized by a rich animal and microbial diversity and therefore by the availability of organic compounds utilizable by yeasts. Higher counts of nonpigmented yeast were obtained using MYPss, whereas for pink yeasts, higher counts were obtained using MYPssS. Moreover, among pink yeasts, some of the MSP-PCR classes obtained were composed of isolates obtained only on MYPssS, which might be an indication that these isolates are adapted to the ecosystems of the hydrothermal vents. Twelve phylotypes belonged to the Ascomycota and seven phylotypes belonged to the Basidiomycota. The nonpigmented yeasts were identified as Candida atlantica, C. atmosphaerica, C. lodderae, C. parapsilosis, Exophiala dermatitidis, Pichia guilliermondii, and Trichosporon dermatis, whereas the pigmented yeasts were identified as Rhodosporidium diobovatum, R. sphaerocarpum, R. toruloides, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Some of the yeasts that were found belong to phylogenetic groups that include species reported from other marine environments, and eight phylotypes represent undescribed species. The new phylotypes found at Mid-Atlantic Ridge hydrothermal fields represent 33{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of the total number of yeast taxa that were found.},

abstract = {The environmental isolation of opportunistic pathogenic black yeasts, which are responsible for a wide spectrum of human infections, is essential to understanding the ecology of clinical fungi. Extreme outdoor environments polluted with aromatic hydrocarbons support the growth of black yeasts in unlikely places, such as railway sleepers. However, there are limited data concerning the diversity of these fungi growing on polluted railway sleepers. In this investigation, we examined 845 railway sleeper samples, obtained from 11 Turkish cities representing altitudes from 25 to 1,893 m, and inoculated the samples onto mycological media for the isolation of black yeasts. Ninety-four samples (11.1 {\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) yielded positive results for black yeast, with creosoted oak sleepers having a significantly higher number of isolates than concrete sleepers (p {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.05). Identification based on the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer region revealed the highest prevalence of Exophiala phaeomuriformis, followed by Exophiala dermatitidis, Exophiala heteromorpha, Exophiala xenobiotica, and Exophiala crusticola. This study revealed that railway sleepers harboring black yeasts were predominantly ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}75 {\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) populated with thermophilic species. We observed that altitude might have a significant effect on species diversity. Briefly, E. phaeomuriformis exhibited growth over a wide altitude range, from 30 to 1,893 m. In contrast, E. dermatitidis had a remarkable aversion to low altitudes and exhibited maximum growth at 1,285 m. In conclusion, we speculate that one can predict what species will be found on railway sleepers and their probability and that species diversity primarily depends on sleeper type and altitude height. We believe that this study can contribute new insights into the ecology of black yeasts on railway sleepers and the railway factors that influence their diversity.},

abstract = {Black yeast members of the Herpotrichiellaceae present a complex ecological behavior: They are often isolated from rather extreme environments polluted with aromatic hydrocarbons, while they are also regularly involved in human opportunistic infections. A selective technique to promote the in vitro growth of herpotrichiellaceous fungi was applied to investigate their ecophysiology. Samples from natural ecological niches and man-made environments that might contain black yeasts were enriched on an inert solid support at low humidity and under a controlled atmosphere rich in volatile aromatic hydrocarbons. Benzene, toluene, and xylene were provided separately as the sole carbon and energy source via the gas phase. The assayed isolation protocol was highly specific toward mesophilic Exophiala species (70 strains of this genus out of 71 isolates). Those were obtained predominantly from creosote-treated railway ties (53 strains), but isolates were also found on wild berries (11 strains) and in guano-rich soil samples (six strains). Most of the isolates were obtained on toluene (43 strains), but enrichments on xylene and benzene also yielded herpotrichiellaceous fungi (17 and 10 isolates, respectively). Based upon morphological characterizations and DNA sequences of the full internal transcriber spacers (ITS) and the 8.5S rRNA genes, the majority of the obtained isolates were affiliated to the recently described species Exophiala xenobiotica (32 strains) and Exophiala bergeri (nine strains). Members of two other phylogenetic groups (24 and two strains, respectively) somewhat related to E. bergeri were also found, and a last group (three strains) corresponded to an undescribed Exophiala species.},

abstract = {Large amount of drilling waste associated with the expansion of the Orinoco Oil Belt (OOB), the biggest proven reserve of extra-heavy crude oil (EHCO) worldwide, is usually impregnated with EHCO and highly salinized water-based drilling fluids. Oxidative exoenzymes (OE) of the lignin-degrading enzyme system (LDS) of fungi catalyse the oxidation of a wide range of toxic pollutants. However, very little evidences on fungal degradation or biotransformation of EHCO have been reported, which contain high amounts of asphaltenes and its biodegradation rate is very limited. The aims of this work were to study the ability of Pestalotiopsis palmarum BM-04 to synthesize OE, its potential to biotransform EHCO and to survive in extreme environmental conditions. Enzymatic studies of the LDS showed the ability of this fungus to overproduce high amounts of laccase (LACp) in presence of wheat bran or lignin peroxidase (LIPp) with EHCO as sole carbon and energy source (1300 U mgP(-1) in both cases). FT-IR spectroscopy with Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) analysis showed the enzymatic oxidation of carbon and sulfur atoms in both maltenes and asphaltenes fractions of biotreated EHCO catalysed by cell-free laccase-enriched OE using wheat bran as inducer. UV-visible spectrophotometry analysis revealed the oxidation of the petroporphyrins in the asphaltenes fraction of biotreated EHCO. Tolerance assays showed the ability of this fungus to grow up to 50,000 p.p.m. of EHCO and 2000 mM of NaCl. These results suggest that P. palmarum BM-04 is a hopeful alternative to be used in remediation processes in extreme environmental conditions of salinity and EHCO contamination, such as the drilling waste from the OOB.},

Folding (secondary structure) prediction for single-stranded RNA or DNA combines free energy minimization, partition function calculations and stochastic sampling. For melting simulations, the package computes entire melting profiles, not just melting temperatures. UV absorbance at 260 nm, heat capacity change (C(p)), and mole fractions of different molecular species are computed as a function of temperature. The package installs and runs on all Unix and Linux platforms that we have looked at, including Mac OS X. Images of secondary structures, hybridizations, and dot plots may be computed using common formats. Similarly, a variety of melting profile plots is created when appropriate. These latter plots include experimental results if they are provided. The package is "command line" driven. Underlying compiled programs may be used individually, or in special combinations through the use of a variety of Perl scripts. Users are encouraged to create their own scripts to supplement what comes with the package.

genomics tool. In the absence of reliable target site selection tools,

RNA-protein interactions that occur throughout the RNAi process,
including short interfering RNA (siRNA) binding and unwinding followed
by target recognition, cleavage, and subsequent product release.
Recently developed strategies for identification of functional siRNAs
reveal that thermodynamic and siRNA sequence-specific properties
are crucial to predict functional duplexes (Khvorova et al., 2003;
Reynolds et al., 2004; Schwarz et al., 2003). Additional assessments
of siRNA specificity reveal that more sophisticated sequence comparison
tools are also required to minimize potential off-target effects

the biological basis for current computational design tools and how

Some species can be recovered from the natural environment by means of selective isolation techniques. The present study focuses on a Cladophialophora strain that caused an interdigital tinea nigra-like lesion in a HIV-positive Brazilian child. The fungal infection was successfully treated with oxiconazole. Similar strains had been recovered from the environment in Brazil, Uruguay and the Netherlands. The strains were characterized by sequencing the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions and the small subunit (SSU) of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene, as well as the elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1alpha) gene. Since no match with any known species was found, it is described as the new species, Cladophialophora saturnica.},

We also compared the relative efficacies of Sabouraud glucose agar (SGA) and Columbia agar (CA) for use in MALDI-TOF MS. Remarkably, we obtained a log-score value ≥2.0 by using either SGA or CA for all 15 CBS strains, indicating species-level identification.

abstract = {The natural habitat of opportunistic fungal pathogens is outside of the host; therefore, it is crucial to understand their ecology and routes of transmission. In this study, we investigated the presence of black and filamentous fungi in moist indoor environments in the city of Mersin in subtropical Turkey. In total, 177 private dwellings were screened and 893 samples obtained using cotton swabs and moistened with physiological saline from dishwashers, washing machines, refrigerators, bath-tubs, bathroom walls, and shower heads. These were then inoculated onto malt extract agar supplemented with chloramphenicol, followed by incubation at 37°C. Thirty samples (3.4{\%}) were positive for fungi, which were then identified by sequencing the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region. Exophiala dermatitidis was the most common species (23), followed by E. phaeomuriformis (three), Magnusiomyces capitatus (two), and Candida parapsilosis (two). Genotype A of E. dermatitidis (14) was more prevalent than genotypes B (eight) and C (one) and E. phaeomuriformis was also represented by two genotypes. Our findings suggest that dishwashers are a major indoor niche for thermophilic black yeasts. The occurrence of the opportunistic filamentous fungus M. capitatus in dishwashers is consistent with a recent report.},

These microorganisms naturally biodegrade numerous contaminating petroleum hydrocarbons, thereby cleansing the oceans of oil pollutants. Bioremediation, which is accomplished by adding exogenous microbial populations or stimulating indigenous ones, attempts to raise the rates of degradation found naturally to significantly higher rates. Seeding with oil degraders has not been demonstrated to be effective, but addition of nitrogenous fertilizers has been shown to increase rates of petroleum biodegradation. In the case of the Exxon Valdez spill, the largest and most thoroughly studied application of bioremediation, the application of fertilizer (slow release or oleophilic) increased rates of biodegradation 3–5 times. Because of the patchiness of oil, an internally conserved compound, hopane, was critical for demonstrating the efficacy of bioremediation. Multiple regression models showed that the effectiveness of bioremediation depended upon the amount of nitrogen delivered, the concentration of oil, and time.},

BacPP is hence outstanding in recognition and assignment of sequences according to $\sigma$ factor and provide circumstantial information about upstream gene sequences.

Furthermore, when challenged with promoter sequences belonging to other enterobacteria BacPP maintained 76{\%} accuracy overall.},

The main characteristic of halophilic enzymes that allows them to be considered as a novel alternative for use in the biotechnological industries is their polyextremophilicity, i.e. they have the capacity to be thermostable, tolerate a wide range of pH, withstand denaturation and tolerate high salt concentrations. However, there have been relatively few studies on halophilic enzymes, with some being based on their isolation and others on their characterisation. These enzymes are scarcely researched because attention has been focused on other extremophile micro-organisms. Only a few industrial applications of halophilic enzymes, principally in the fermented food, textile, pharmaceutical and leather industries, have been reported. However, it is important to investigate applications of these enzymes in more biotechnological processes at both the chemical and the molecular level. This review discusses the modifications of these enzymes, their industrial applications and research perspectives in different biotechnological areas.},

These evolutionarily conserved peptides are usually positively charged and have both a hydrophobic and hydrophilic side that enables the molecule to be soluble in aqueous environments yet also enter lipid-rich membranes. Once in a target microbial membrane, the peptide kills target cells through diverse mechanisms. Cathelicidins and defensins are major groups of epidermal AMPs. Decreased levels of these peptides have been noted for patients with atopic dermatitis and Kostmann's syndrome, a congenital neutropenia. In addition to important antimicrobial properties, growing evidence indicates that AMPs alter the host immune response through receptor-dependent interactions. AMPs have been shown to be important in such diverse functions as angiogenesis, wound healing, and chemotaxis. As our knowledge of AMP biology expands, the precise role and relevance of these peptides will be better elucidated.},

abstract = {The ATP-dependent Lon protease is involved in many physiological processes. In bacteria, Lon regulates pathogenesis and, in yeast, Lon protects mitochondia from oxidative damage. However, little is known about Lon in fungal phytopathogens. MAP1, a homologue of Lon in Magnaporthe oryzae, was recently identified to be important for stress resistance and pathogenesis. Here, we focus on a novel pathogenic pathway mediated by MAP1. Based on an interaction system between rice and a tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged MAP1 complementation strain, we identified 23 novel fungal proteins from infected leaves using a TAP approach with mass spectrometry, and confirmed that 14 of these proteins physically interact with MAP1 in vivo. Among these 14 proteins, 11 candidates, presumably localized to the mitochondria, were biochemically determined to be substrates of MAP1 hydrolysis. Deletion mutants were created and functionally analysed to further confirm the involvement of these proteins in pathogenesis. The results indicated that all mutants showed reduced conidiation and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Appressorial formations were not affected, although conidia from certain mutants were morphologically altered. In addition, virulence was reduced in four mutants, enhanced (with lesions forming earlier) in two mutants and remained unchanged in one mutant. Together with the known virulence-related proteins alternative oxidase and enoyl-CoA hydratase, we propose that most of the Lon-interacting proteins are involved in the pathogenic regulation pathway mediated by MAP1 in M. oryzae. Perturbation of this pathway may represent an effective approach for the inhibition of rice blast disease.},

abstract = {Bovine fetuin often finds use as a test model for analytical methods, but the exact occupancy of its O-glycosylation sites has not yet been determined. An obstacle for a closer inspection of the five or six O-glycosylation sites is the close spacing of several sites on the same tryptic peptide. The advent of ion-trap instruments with electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) capability and – for the type of instrument – high resolution prompted us to probe this technology for the investigation of the intricate posttranslational modifications O-glycosylation and phosphorylation. Much information could be obtained by direct-infusion ETD analysis of the fully sialylated tryptic 61-residue peptide harboring 8 hydroxyl amino acids of which four were indeed found to be, if only partially, glycosylated. The middle-down approach allowed recognizing an order of action of O-GalNAc transferase(s). No such hierarchy could be observed for phosphorylation. ETD fragmentation on an ion trap thus allowed in-depth analysis of a large, multiply O-glycosylated peptide, however, only by data accumulation over several minutes by direct infusion of a prefractionated sample. O-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites re-defined and their occupancy including that of N-glycans were defined by this study. 

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
O-glycosylation of natural or recombinant proteins poses a challenge because of the lack of unambiguous consensus sites, the agglomeration of several O-glycans in close proximity and the lack of efficient O-glycosidases. Even bovine fetuin, a frequently used test glycoprotein for glycosylation analysis, has hitherto not been fully characterized in terms of site occupancy. This gap shall hereby be closed by application of electron-transfer dissociation mass spectroscopy.},

abstract = {The response of the cold-adapted (psychrophilic) methanogenic archaeon Methanococcoides burtonii to growth temperature was investigated using differential proteomics (postincorporation isobaric labeling) and tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS). This is the first proteomic study of M. burtonii to include techniques that specifically enrich for both surface and membrane proteins and to assess the effects of growth temperature (4 vs 23 degrees C) and carbon source (trimethylamine vs methanol) on cellular protein levels. Numerous surface layer proteins were more abundant at 4 degrees C, indicating an extensive remodeling of the cell envelope in response to low temperature. Many of these surface proteins contain domains associated with cell adhesion. Within the cell, small proteins each composed of a single TRAM domain were recovered as important cold adaptation proteins and might serve as RNA chaperones, in an analogous manner to Csp proteins (absent from M. burtonii). Other proteins that had higher abundances at 4 degrees C can be similarly tied to relieving or resolving the adverse affects of cold growth temperature on translational capacity and correct protein folding. The proteome of M. burtonii grown at 23 degrees C was dominated by oxidative stress proteins, as well as a large number of integral membrane proteins of unknown function. This is the first truly global proteomic study of a psychrophilic archaeon and greatly expands knowledge of the cellular mechanisms underpinning cold adaptation in the Archaea.},

abstract = {We have previously reported the posttranslational addition of [14C]-arginine in the N-terminus of several soluble rat brain proteins. One of these proteins was identified as the microtubule-associated protein, the stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP). However, despite the fact that the biological significance of arginylation is not completely understood, some evidence associates it with proteolysis via the ubiquitin pathway. Since this degradative via is exacerbated as a response to stress, we studied in vitro the posttranslational [14C]-arginylation of cytosolic brain proteins of rats subjected to hyperthermia in vivo. Immediately after subjecting the animals to hyperthermia, a minor reduction (16{\%}) in the acceptor capacity of [14C]-arginine into proteins was observed in comparison with animals maintained at 28 degrees C. However, in the animals allowed to recover for 3 h, an increase (46{\%}) in the arginylation was observed concomitantly with a significant accumulation of the heat shock protein (70 kDa; hsp 70) when compared to the control animals. These findings suggest that the posttranslational arginylation of proteins participate in the heat shock response. The STOP protein of the soluble brain fraction of control animals, which in Western blot appears as a doublet band (125 and 130 kDa, respectively), is seen, after the hyperthermic treatment, as a single band of 125 kDa. The amount of 125 kDa protein, as well as the in vitro incorporation of [14C]-arginine, increases after hyperthermia in comparison with control animals. Following hyperthermic treatment, we observed a decrease in the amount of in vivo [35S]-methionine-labeled brain proteins. We speculate that, as observed for STOP protein, the increase in the degradation of protein that occurs in hyperthermia, would produce an increase in the amount of arginine acceptor proteins.},

abstract = {We previously reported that centrally-induced sympathetic activation in response to cold stress is associated with a polycystic ovarian condition in rats, and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) released locally from the magnocellular region of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) appears to be involved in this activation. Because TRH neurones express NMDA glutamate receptors, in the present study, we investigated the role of glutamate in the increased release of TRH from magnocellular neurones induced by cold stress and its relationship to ovarian neurotransmission. Animals with a push-pull cannula stereotaxically implanted into the magnocellular portion of the PVN were exposed to cold stress (4 degrees C for 64 h) and subjected to intracerebral perfusion. Perfusate fractions were obtained and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography to measure glutamate and GABA levels. Glutamate, but not GABA, release increased significantly in animals perfused under cold exposure. In vivo administration of glutamate to the PVN increased TRH release. Injection of MK-801 into the magnocellular portion of the PVN reduced ovarian noradrenaline turnover and led to an increase in catecholamine concentration from the adrenal glands and celiac ganglia. Taken together, the results obtained in the present study strongly suggest that glutamate release from the magnocellular PVN is sensitive to cold stress and that glutamate acts through the NMDA receptor to mediate cold-induced TRH release. This in turn triggers hypothalamic-ovarian pathway activation, which might be responsible for the polycystic condition induced by cold stress and other ovarian pathologies characterised by increased sympathetic discharge.},

abstract = {Secondary structure is evaluated for determining evolutionary relationships between catalytic RNA molecules that are so distantly related they are scarcely alignable. The ribonucleoproteins RNase P (P) and RNase MRP (MRP) have been suggested to be evolutionarily related because of similarities in both function and secondary structure. However, their RNA sequences cannot be aligned with any confidence, and this leads to uncertainty in any trees inferred from sequences. We report several approaches to using secondary structures for inferring evolutionary trees and emphasize quantitative tests to demonstrate that evolutionary information can be recovered. For P and MRP, three hypotheses for the relatedness are considered. The first is that MRP is derived from P in early eukaryotes. The next is that MRP is derived from P from an early endosymbiont. The third is that both P and MRP evolved in the RNA-world (and the need for MRP has since been lost in prokaryotes). Quantitative comparisons of the pRNA and mrpRNA secondary structures have found that the possibility of an organellar origin of MRP is unlikely. In addition, comparison of secondary structures support the identity of an RNase P-like sequence in the maize chloroplast genome. Overall, it is concluded that RNA secondary structure is useful for evaluating evolutionary relatedness, even with sequences that cannot be aligned with confidence.},

A wide range of fungi including ascomycetes, basidiomycetyes, and zygomycetes possesses multiple RNA silencing components in the genome, whereas a portion of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi apparently lacks the whole or most of the components. The number of paralogous silencing proteins in the genome differs considerably among fungal species, suggesting that RNA silencing pathways have diversified significantly during evolution in parallel with developing the complexity of life cycle or in response to environmental conditions. Interestingly, orthologous silencing proteins from different fungal clades are often clustered more closely than paralogous proteins in a fungus, indicating that duplication events occurred before speciation events. Therefore, the origin of multiple RNA silencing pathways seems to be very ancient, likely having occurred prior to the divergence of the major fungal lineages.},

Such a profile HMM is typically constructed from a multiple alignment of a set of related sequences. Transition probability parameters in an HMM are used to model insertions and deletions in the alignment. We show here that taking into account unrelated sequences when estimating the transition probability parameters helps to construct more discriminative models for the global/local alignment mode. After normal HMM training, a simple heuristic is employed that adjusts the transition probabilities between match and delete states according to observed transitions in the training set relative to the unrelated (noise) set. The method is called adaptive transition probabilities (ATP) and is based on the HMMER package implementation. It was benchmarked in two remote homology tests based on the Pfam and the SCOP classifications. Compared to the HMMER default procedure, the rate of misclassification was reduced significantly in both tests and across all levels of error rate.},

Expression of the hph gene confers resistance to antibiotic HmB. Selection for resistance, indicative of transformation, resulted in 10 203 HmB-resistant colonies/micrograms pAN7-1 on medium containing 100 micrograms HmB/ml. Strains of W. dermatitidis used in this study have innate sensitivity to HmB at a critical inhibitory concentration of 20-40 micrograms/ml. Vectors pWU44 and pKK5 contain a URA5 gene from Podospora anserina. A ura5 auxotroph of W. dermatitidis was transformed to prototrophy with pWU44 or pKK5 by complementation. Transformation frequencies for these two plasmids were between 17-50 transformants/micrograms vector DNA.

abstract = {By using improved transformation methods for Wangiella dermatitidis, and a cloned fragment of its chitin synthase 4 structural gene (WdCHS4) as a marking sequence, the full-length gene was rescued from the genome of this human pathogenic fungus. The encoded chitin synthase product (WdChs4p) showed high homology with Chs3p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other class IV chitin synthases, and Northern blotting showed that WdCHS4 was expressed at constitutive levels under all conditions tested. Reduced chitin content, abnormal yeast clumpiness and budding kinetics, and increased melanin secretion resulted from the disruption of WdCHS4 suggesting that WdChs4p influences cell wall structure, cellular reproduction, and melanin deposition, respectively. However, no significant loss of virulence was detected when the wdchs4Delta strain was tested in an acute mouse model. Using a wdchs1Delta wdchs2Delta wdchs3Delta triple mutant of W. dermatitidis, which grew poorly but adequately at 25 degrees C, we assayed WdChs4p activity in the absence of activities contributed by its three other WdChs proteins. Maximal activity required trypsin activation, suggesting a zymogenic nature. The activity also had a pH optimum of 7.5, was most stimulated by Mg(2+), and was more inhibited by polyoxin D than by nikkomycin Z. Although the WdChs4p activity had a broad temperature optimum between 30 to 45 degrees C in vitro, this activity alone did not support the growth of the wdchs1Delta wdchs2Delta wdchs3Delta triple mutant at 37 degrees C, a temperature commensurate with infection.},

abstract = {Pandora formicae is an obligate entomopathogenic fungus from the phylum Entomophthoromycota, known to infect only ants from the genus Formica. In the final stages of infection, the fungus induces the so-called summit disease syndrome, manipulating the host to climb up vegetation prior to death and fixing the dead cadaver to the surface, all to increase efficient spore dispersal. To investigate this fascinating pathogen-host interaction, we constructed interaction transcriptome libraries from two final infection stages from the material sampled in the field: (1) when the cadavers were fixed, but the fungus had not grown out through the cuticle and (2) when the fungus was growing out from host cadaver and producing spores. These phases mark the switch from within-host growth to reproduction on the host surface, after fungus outgrowth through host integument. In this first de novo transcriptome of an entomophthoralean fungus, we detected expression of many pathogenicity-related genes, including secreted hydrolytic enzymes and genes related to morphological reorganization and nutrition uptake. Differences in expression of genes in these two infection phases were compared and showed a switch in enzyme expression related to either cuticle breakdown or cell proliferation and cell wall remodeling, particularly in subtilisin-like serine protease and trypsin-like protease transcripts.},

abstract = {CRISPR/Cas9 uses a guide RNA (gRNA) molecule to execute sequence-specific DNA cleavage and it has been widely used for genome editing in many organisms. Modifications at either end of the gRNAs often render Cas9/gRNA inactive. So far, production of gRNA in vivo has only been achieved by using the U6 and U3 snRNA promoters. However, the U6 and U3 promoters have major limitations such as a lack of cell specificity and unsuitability for in vitro transcription. Here, we present a versatile method for efficiently producing gRNAs both in vitro and in vivo. We design an artificial gene named RGR that, once transcribed, generates an RNA molecule with ribozyme sequences at both ends of the designed gRNA. We show that the primary transcripts of RGR undergo self-catalyzed cleavage to generate the desired gRNA, which can efficiently guide sequence-specific cleavage of DNA targets both in vitro and in yeast. RGR can be transcribed from any promoters and thus allows for cell- and tissue-specific genome editing if appropriate promoters are chosen. Detecting mutations generated by CRISPR is often achieved by enzyme digestions, which are not very compatible with high-throughput analysis. Our system allows for the use of universal primers to produce any gRNAs in vitro, which can then be used with Cas9 protein to detect mutations caused by the gRNAs/CRISPR. In conclusion, we provide a versatile method for generating targeted mutations in specific cells and tissues, and for efficiently detecting the mutations generated.},

After 12 h of inoculation a tenacious adherence between the spores and the stratum corneum was observed. There was a time dependent increase in the number of spores adhered to this surface. By 24 h, germination had commenced. The initial growth of germ tubes occurred extracellularly to the corneocytes. Three days after inoculation, the most prominent feature was proliferation of fungal hyphae and penetration of mycelium through the outer keratinocyte layer which is followed by invasion of the outer stratum corneum.

abstract = {Fungi rarely cause disease outbreaks associated with use of microbe-contaminated drugs. These rare episodes typically involve a restricted spectrum of common environmental species with relatively low virulence, rather than classical pathogens. Review of data involving over-the-counter contact lens solutions and prescription drug-related recalls revealed six episodes during the past decade with significant adverse health and financial impact (including loss of vision and death). Contaminations involved fungi mostly identified with the genera Aspergillus, Exserohilum, Fusarium, Paecilomyces, and Rhizopus. These organisms are noted for their capacity to produce resistant morphotypes (chlamydoconidia, ascospores) under various adverse conditions, generally with temperature survival/tolerances markedly in excess of maximal growth temperatures. High constituent levels of melanin, trehalose and heat-shock proteins facilitate differential survival of morphotypes following exposures to toxic chemicals and temperatures above 80 °C. Adverse environmental factors that induce resistant morphotypes are suggested to occur more readily in situ than during in vitro testing. Rare unexplained, sporadic drug contamination episodes with select thermotolerant fungi may relate, in part, to resistant dormant stages.},

The method is based on an automated system that utilizes Microplates manufactured by Biolog, Inc. (Hayward, CA, USA). This system detects bacterial respiratory activity from the oxidation of a carbon source introduced in volatile form. This is in contrast to the original design, which is based on inoculating a carbon source directly into each well. The 96-well (MT) microtiter plates contain nutrients and a tetrazolium dye. When a bacterial species is capable of oxidizing a volatile carbon substrate, the dye turns purple, and a spectrophotometric plate reader quantifies the response. As a test of this method 150 isolates, including isolates known to degrade some of the test compounds and negative controls were evaluated for their potential to oxidize carbon tetrachloride, toluene, and o-xylene. Thirty-seven isolates (25{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) were qualitatively identified as contaminant oxidizers, and thirteen of these (35{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) showed significant degradation capabilities for both toluene and o-xylene.},

abstract = {PAHs are aromatic hydrocarbons with two or more fused benzene rings with natural as well as anthropogenic sources. They are widely distributed environmental contaminants that have detrimental biological effects, toxicity, mutagenecity and carcinogenicity. Due to their ubiquitous occurrence, recalcitrance, bioaccumulation potential and carcinogenic activity, the PAHs have gathered significant environmental concern. Although PAH may undergo adsorption, volatilization, photolysis, and chemical degradation, microbial degradation is the major degradation process. PAH degradation depends on the environmental conditions, number and type of the microorganisms, nature and chemical structure of the chemical compound being degraded. They are biodegraded/biotransformed into less complex metabolites, and through mineralization into inorganic minerals, H(2)O, CO(2) (aerobic) or CH(4) (anaerobic) and rate of biodegradation depends on pH, temperature, oxygen, microbial population, degree of acclimation, accessibility of nutrients, chemical structure of the compound, cellular transport properties, and chemical partitioning in growth medium. A number of bacterial species are known to degrade PAHs and most of them are isolated from contaminated soil or sediments. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomons fluoresens, Mycobacterium spp., Haemophilus spp., Rhodococcus spp., Paenibacillus spp. are some of the commonly studied PAH-degrading bacteria. Lignolytic fungi too have the property of PAH degradation. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Bjerkandera adusta, and Pleurotus ostreatus are the common PAH-degrading fungi. Enzymes involved in the degradation of PAHs are oxygenase, dehydrogenase and lignolytic enzymes. Fungal lignolytic enzymes are lignin peroxidase, laccase, and manganese peroxidase. They are extracellular and catalyze radical formation by oxidation to destabilize bonds in a molecule. The biodegradation of PAHs has been observed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and the rate can be enhanced by physical/chemical pretreatment of contaminated soil. Addition of biosurfactant-producing bacteria and light oils can increase the bioavailability of PAHs and metabolic potential of the bacterial community. The supplementation of contaminated soils with compost materials can also enhance biodegradation without long-term accumulation of extractable polar and more available intermediates. Wetlands, too, have found an application in PAH removal from wastewater. The intensive biological activities in such an ecosystem lead to a high rate of autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. Aquatic weeds Typha spp. and Scirpus lacustris have been used in horizontal-vertical macrophyte based wetlands to treat PAHs. An integrated approach of physical, chemical, and biological degradation may be adopted to get synergistically enhanced removal rates and to treat/remediate the contaminated sites in an ecologically favorable process.},

Eight screening assays with emphasis on application of non-sterile conditions were carried out in order to select the strains with capability to withstand indigenous microbes and contamination. Nine fungi were then selected for degrading pentachlorophenol (PCP), and 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol (2,3,4,6-TeCP) and mineralizing radiolabelled pentachlorophenol ((14)C-PCP) in non-sterile soil or wood during 15 weeks of incubation. Soil indigenous microbes and fungal inoculated soil (fungal inoculum+indigenous microbes) achieved similar degradation of PCP and 2,3,4,6-TeCP and mineralization of (14)C-PCP. However, the mineralization rate of (14)C-PCP by indigenous microbes was much slower than that boosted by fungal inoculum. The litter-decomposing fungus (LDF) Stropharia rugosoannulata proved to be a suitable fungus for soil treatment.

We have previously shown that E. dermatitidis frequently colonises the airways of patients with CF. The aims of the present study were to determine whether patients who are colonised by E. dermatitidis have detectable fungal antigens in the circulation, develop anti-fungal antibodies, and show signs of inflammation and impaired respiratory function.

METHODS: We collected sputum and serum samples consecutively from 98 sputum-producing patients with CF aged more than 12years. The serum samples were subjected to bacterial and fungal culturing and analyses for fungal antigens and inflammatory factors.

RESULTS: E. dermatitidis was recovered from 17 (17{\%}) patients, the same isolation rate as for Aspergillus fumigatus. There were no difference regarding the levels of $\beta$-glucan in the sera from E. dermatitidis culture-positive and culture-negative patients with CF. Serological analysis revealed significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies to E. dermatitidis cell wall fragments in the E. dermatitidis culture-positive patients. Patients with higher level of E. dermatitidis IgG antibodies were more often colonised with non-tuberculous Mycobacteria, and less often with Staphylococcus aureus. The increased levels of IgG antibodies directed against E. dermatitidis were positively associated with higher white blood cell counts, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, pancreatic insufficiency, intravenous antibiotic treatment, and they were negatively associated with respiratory function (FEV1 {\%} predicted). Overall, 4/17 Exophiala-positive patients were diagnosed as having symptomatic infection with E. dermatitidis and were treated with broad-spectrum azoles.

CONCLUSION: E. dermatitidis triggers antibody production and may cause significant airway infection in patients with cystic fibrosis.},

We re-identified 188 clinical isolates from the United States, which had a preliminary morphological identification of Exophiala species, by sequencing internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA. Molecular identifications of the strains were as follows, in order of frequency: 55 E. dermatitidis (29.3{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 37 E. xenobiotica (19.7{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 35 E. oligosperma (18.6{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 13 E. lecanii-corni (6.9{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 12 E. phaeomuriformis (6.4{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 7 E. jeanselmei (3.7{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 7 E. bergeri (3.7{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 6 E. mesophila (3.2{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 5 E. spinifera (2.7{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 3 Exophiala sp. 1 (1.6{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 3 E. attenuata (1.6{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 3 Phialophora europaea (1.3{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), 1 E. heteromorpha (0.5{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), and 1 Exophiala sp. 2 (0.5{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) strains. Exophiala strains were repeatedly isolated from deep infections (39.9{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) involving lung, pleural fluid, sputum, digestive organs (stomach, intestines, bile), heart, brain, spleen, bone marrow, blood, dialysis fluid, lymph node, joint, breast, middle ear, throat, and intraocular tissues. About 38.3{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of the Exophiala spp. strains were agents of cutaneous infections including skin, mucous membranes, nail, and corneal epithelium lesions. The other strains caused superficial infections (0.5{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}, including hair) or subcutaneous infection (12.0{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}, including paranasal sinusitis, mycetoma, and subcutaneous cyst). The systemic infections were preponderantly caused by E. dermatitidis, E. oligosperma, E. phaeomuriformis, E. xenobiotica, and E. lecanii-corni. Strains of E. bergeri, E. spinifera, E. jeanselmei, E. mesophila, and E. attenuata mainly induced cutaneous and subcutaneous infections. Since relatively few unknown ITS motifs were encountered, we suppose that the list of opportunistic Exophiala species in temperate climates is nearing completion, but a number of species still have to be described.},

abstract = {Leishmania parasites must survive and proliferate in two vastly different environs - the guts of poikilothermic sandflies and the antigen-presenting cells of homeothermic mammals. The change of temperature during transmission from sandflies to mammals is both a key trigger for the progression of their life cycle and for elevated synthesis of heat shock proteins which have been implicated in survival at higher temperatures. While the main heat shock protein families have been studied for their function in the Leishmania life cycle, nothing is known about the roles played by small heat shock proteins. Here, we present first evidence for the pivotal role played by the Leishmania donovani 23-kD heat shock protein which is expressed preferentially in the mammalian stage where it assumes a perinuclear localisation. Loss of HSP23 causes increased sensitivity to chemical stressors, but renders L. donovani incapable of surviving at 37°C. Consequently, HSP23 null mutants are non-infectious to primary macrophages in vitro. All phenotypic effect can be abrogated by the introduction of a functional HSP23 transgene into the null mutant, confirming the specificity of the mutant phenotype. Thus, HSP23 expression is a prerequisite for L. donovani survival at mammalian host temperatures and a crucial virulence factor.},

However, synthetic biologists have been looking for new molecular "parts" that function as modular units required in designing and constructing new "devices" and "systems" for regulating cell function because the number of such parts is strictly limited at present. In this review, we focus on RNA/ribonucleoprotein (RNP) architectures that hold promise as new "parts" for synthetic biology. They are constructed with molecular design and an experimental evolution technique. So far, designed self-folding RNAs, RNA (RNP) enzymes, and nanoscale RNA architectures have been successfully constructed by utilizing Watson-Crick base-pairs together with specific RNA-RNA or RNA-protein binding motifs of known defined 3D structures. Riboregulators for regulating targeted gene expression have also been designed and produced in vitro as well as in vivo. Lately, RNA and ribonucleoprotein complexes have been strongly attracting the attention of molecular biologists because a variety of noncoding RNAs discovered in nature perform spatiotemporal gene expressions. Thus we hope that newly accumulating knowledge on naturally occurring RNAs and RNP complexes will provide a variety of new parts, devices and systems for synthetic biology.},

abstract = {Nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase) is a very abundant protein secreted by the obligate intracellular parasiteToxoplasma gondii shortly after invasion of the host cell. When activated by dithiols, NTPase is one of the most potent apyrases known to date, but its physiological function remains unknown. The genes encoding NTPase have been cloned (Bermudes, D., Peck, K. R., Afifi-Afifi, M., Beckers, C. J. M., and Joiner, K. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29252-29260). We have recently shown that the enzyme is tightly controlled within the vacuolar space and may influence parasite exit from the host cell (Silverman, J. A., Qi, H., Riehl, A., Beckers, C., Nakaar, V., and Joiner, K. A (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 12352-12359). In the present study, we have generated an antisense NTP RNA construct in which the 3'-untranslated region is replaced by a hammerhead ribozyme. The constitutive synthesis of the chimeric antisense RNA-ribozyme construct in parasites that were stably transfected with this construct resulted in a dramatic reduction in the steady-state levels of NTPase. This inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the capacity of the parasites to replicate. The reduction in parasite proliferation was due to a specific effect of antisense NTP RNA, since a drastic inhibition of hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HXGPRT) expression by a chimeric antisense HXGPRT RNA-ribozyme construct did not alter NTPase expression nor compromise parasite replication. These data implicate NTPase in an essential parasite function and suggest that NTPase may have more than one function in vivo. These results also establish that it is possible to study gene function in apicomplexan parasites using antisense RNA coupled to ribozymes.},

A pneumococcal {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashDelta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}pdxR mutant also exhibited as a vitamin B₆ auxotroph. In addition, we found that disruption of the vitamin B₆ biosynthesis pathway in S. pneumoniae caused a significant attenuation in a chinchilla middle ear infection model and a minor attenuation in a mouse pneumonia model, indicating that the impact of vitamin B₆ synthesis on virulence depends upon the bacterial infection niche.},

abstract = {Class III chitin synthases are important for hyphal growth in some filamentous fungi but are not found in yeasts. Using a specific PCR product that encodes a portion of the class III chitin synthase of W. dermatitidis as a probe, we isolated the chitin synthase gene, WdCHS3, from this polymorphic melanized pathogen of humans. Northern blotting showed that WdCHS3 was highly expressed under stress conditions, such as the shift of cells to temperatures commensurate with infection, or to conditions that induce cellular morphogenesis in this fungus. Analysis of the 5' upstream sequence of WdCHS3 provided evidence for a negative regulatory element at between [-]780 and [-]1600 bp. Western blotting indicated that the production of the WdChs3p was temperature dependent and temporally regulated. Disruption of WdCHS3 in a wild-type strain and in two temperature-sensitive morphological mutants resulted in significantly reduced chitin synthase activities but did not obviously affect their morphologies, growth rates, chitin contents, or virulence. This paradox suggested that the contributions of the high levels of WdCHS3 gene expression and WdChs3p production in strains subjected to stress reside in unknown or unexamined parts of the life cycle of this ecologically poorly known member of the Fungi Imperfecti. Nonetheless, this report presents the first evidence that transcription of a chitin synthase gene is regulated by a negative regulatory element in its 5' upstream sequence.},

Expression of the constitutively active allele wdcdc42(G14V) at 37 degrees C induced nonpolarized growth that led to cell enlargement and multiple nucleation. The swollen cells subsequently converted into planate divided bicellular forms or multiply septated sclerotic bodies in post-log phase, when the G14V-altered protein was diminished. The wdcdc42(G14V) mutation also strongly repressed filamentous growth both in the wild-type strain and in the temperature-sensitive hyphal-form mutant Hf1. In contrast, overexpression of the dominant negative alleles wdcdc42(T19N) and wdcdc42(D120A) had no obvious effect on fungal-cell polarization. These results suggested that WdCdc42p plays a unique regulatory role in cellular morphogenesis in W. dermatitidis. Activation of this protein in response to extracellular or intracellular signals seems to commit its yeast-like cells to a phenotype transition that produces sclerotic bodies while repressing hyphal development.},

Transcript structure, operon linkages, and information on absolute abundance all provide valuable insights into gene function and regulation, but none has ever been determined on a genome-wide scale for any bacterium. Indeed, these aspects of the prokaryotic transcriptome have been explored on a large scale in only a few instances, and consequently little is known about the absolute composition of the mRNA population within a bacterial cell. Here we report the use of a high-throughput sequencing-based approach in assembling the first comprehensive, single-nucleotide resolution view of a bacterial transcriptome. We sampled the Bacillus anthracis transcriptome under a variety of growth conditions and showed that the data provide an accurate and high-resolution map of transcript start sites and operon structure throughout the genome. Further, the sequence data identified previously nonannotated regions with significant transcriptional activity and enhanced the accuracy of existing genome annotations. Finally, our data provide estimates of absolute transcript abundance and suggest that there is significant transcriptional heterogeneity within a clonal, synchronized bacterial population. Overall, our results offer an unprecedented view of gene expression and regulation in a bacterial cell.},

Data on the volatility, solubility, ionization and water-air distribution ratio at 25 degrees C are included. From the currently recommended threshold limit value (TLV), a safe dilution factor and an odor safety factor are calculated for each compound. The equivalent data are presented for both air and water dilutions of the chemicals. Available data are summarized on the variability of odor sensitivities in the population, and the increased odor concentrations that are required to elicit responses from persons whose attention is distracted, or who are sleeping.

abstract = {Clinical grade Alzheimer's disease (AD) is only described in humans. Recent imaging studies in early AD patients showed that the parietal areas display the most prominent metabolic impairments. So far, neuroimaging studies have not been able to explain why the medial parietal regions possess this hub characteristic in AD. Paleoneurological and neuroanatomical studies suggest that our species, Homo sapiens, has a unique and derived organization of the parietal areas, which are involved in higher cognitive functions. Combining evidence from neuroimaging, paleontology, and comparative anatomy, we suggest that the vulnerability of the parietal lobe to neurodegenerative processes may be associated with the origin of our species. The species-specific parietal morphology in modern humans largely influenced the brain spatial organization, and it involved changes in vascularization and energy management, which may underlie the sensitivity of these areas to metabolic impairment. Metabolic constraints and anatomical evolutionary changes in the medial parietal regions of modern humans may be important in early AD onset. Taking into account the species-specific adaptations of the modern human parietal areas and their association with AD, we hypothesize that AD can be the evolutionary drawback of the specialized structure of our parietal lobes. The cognitive advantage is associated with increased sensitivity to neurodegenerative processes which, being limited to the post-reproductive period, have a minor effect on the overall genetic fitness. The changes of energy requirements associated with form and size variations at the parietal areas may support the hypothesis of AD as a metabolic syndrome.},

Representatives of the five major spliceosomal snRNAs were found in all genomes. None of the minor splicesomal snRNAs were detected in nematodes or in the shotgun traces of Oikopleura dioica, while in all other animal genomes at most one of them is missing. Although snRNAs are present in multiple copies in most genomes, distinguishable paralogue groups are not stable over long evolutionary times, although they appear independently in several clades. In general, animal snRNA secondary structures are highly conserved, albeit, in particular, U11 and U12 in insects exhibit dramatic variations. An analysis of genomic context of snRNAs reveals that they behave like mobile elements, exhibiting very little syntenic conservation.},

abstract = {OxyS is a small untranslated RNA that is induced in response to oxidative
stress in Escherichia coli. This small RNA acts as a global regulator
affecting the expression of multiple genes. OxyS represses the translation
of fhlA, a transcriptional activator for formate metabolism. Previously,
we have shown that fhlA repression by OxyS is mediated through base-pairing
with a short sequence overlapping the ribosome binding site. Here
we show that the OxyS-fhlA interaction involves a second site residing
further downstream, within the coding region of fhlA. Mutations that
disrupt pairing at this site affect the ability of OxyS to prevent
30 S ribosomes from binding to fhlA mRNA. Structure probing of fhlA
mRNA demonstrates that both sites reside in the loops of two stem-loop
structures. OxyS-fhlA pairing analysis shows that OxyS binds wild-type
fhlA with an apparent dissociation constant of 25 nM, indicating
that kissing complex formation between OxyS and fhlA results in a
stable antisense-target complex. Mutations at either site, which
disrupt pairing of OxyS to fhlA, decrease the stability of this complex.
Our results indicate that kissing complex formation is sufficient
to repress fhlA translation by OxyS.},

abstract = {2'-O-ribose methylation of eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs is guided by RNA duplexes consisting of rRNA and box C/D small nucleolar (sno)RNA sequences, the methylated sites invariably mapping five positions apart from the D box. Here we have analyzed the RNA duplex pairing constraints by investigating the features of 415 duplexes from the fungus, plant and animal kingdoms, and the evolution of those duplexes within the 124 sets they group into. The D-box upstream 1st and {\textgreater}or=15th positions consist of Watson-Crick base-pairs, G:U base-pairs and mismatched bases with ratios close to random assortments; these positions display single base differences in {\textgreater}60{\%} of the RNA duplex sets. The D-box upstream 2nd to 11th positions have {\textgreater}90{\%} Watson-Crick base-pairs; they display single base mutations with a U-shaped distribution of lower values of 0{\%} and 1.6{\%} at the methylated site 5th and 4th positions, and double compensatory mutations leading to new Watson-Crick base-pairs with an inverted U-shaped distribution of higher values at the 8th to 11th positions. Half of the single mutations at the 3rd to 11th positions resulted in G:U base-pairing, mainly through A--{\textgreater}G mutations in the rRNA strands and C--{\textgreater}T mutations in the snoRNA strands. Double compensatory mutations at the 3rd to 11th positions are extremely frequent, representing 36{\%} of all mutations; they frequently arose from an A--{\textgreater}G mutation in the rRNA strands followed by a T--{\textgreater}C mutation in the snoRNA strands. Differences in the mutational pathways through which the rRNA and snoRNA strand evolved must be related to differences in the rRNA and snoRNA copy number and gene organization. Altogether these data identify the D-box upstream 3rd to 11th positions as box C/D snoRNA-rRNA duplex cores. The impact of the pairing constraints on the evolution of the 9 base-pair RNA duplex cores is discussed.},

the design of RNA molecules with specific structural properties has
many potential applications, e.g. in the context of investigating
the function of biological RNAs, of creating new ribozymes, or of
designing artificial RNA nanostructures. Here, we present a new algorithm
for solving the following RNA secondary structure design problem:
given a secondary structure, find an RNA sequence (if any) that is
predicted to fold to that structure. Unlike the (pseudoknot-free)
secondary structure prediction problem, this problem appears to be
hard computationally. Our new algorithm, RNA Secondary Structure
Designer (RNA-SSD), is based on stochastic local search, a prominent
general approach for solving hard combinatorial problems. A thorough
empirical evaluation on computationally predicted structures of biological
sequences and artificially generated RNA structures as well as on
empirically modelled structures from the biological literature shows
that RNA-SSD substantially out-performs the best known algorithm
for this problem, RNAinverse from the Vienna RNA Package. In particular,
the new algorithm is able to solve structures, consistently, for
which RNAinverse is unable to find solutions. The RNA-SSD software
is publically available under the name of RNA Designer at the RNASoft

However, base-triples, an important RNA structural element, cannot be predicted accurately from sequence data. We show here that the poor base correlations observed at base-triple positions are the result of two factors. (1) Base covariation is not as strictly required in triples as it is in Watson-Crick pairs. (2) Base-triple structures are less conserved among homologous molecules. A particularity of known triple-helical regions is the presence of multiple base correlations that do not reflect direct pairing. We suggest that natural mutations in base-triples create structural changes that require compensatory mutations in adjacent base-pairs and triples to maintain the triple-helix conformation. On the basis of these observations, we devised two new measures of association that significantly enhance the base-triple signal in correlation studies. We evaluated correlations between base-pairs and single stranded bases, and correlations between adjacent base-pairs. Positions that score well in both analyses are the best triple candidates. This procedure correctly identifies triples, or interactions very close to the proposed triples, in type I and type II tRNAs and in the group I intron.},

abstract = {The specificity of siRNA-mediated suppression of gene expression
involves base-base recognition between siRNA and its single-stranded
RNA target. We investigated the kinetics of this process in vitro
by using full-length ICAM-1 target RNA and biologically active and
inactive ICAM-1-directed siRNA, respectively. To mimic the situation
in living cells we used the well-characterised facilitator of RNA-RNA
annealing and strand exchange cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, which
increases strongly the kinetics of RNA-RNA interactions at conditions
that do not affect RNA structure nor the presumed structure-function
relationship. For the biologically active siRNA si2B, we find faster
binding, i.e. recognition of the target and a slower backward reaction
when compared with the biologically inactive siRNA si1. This is reflected
by an approximately 400-fold more favorable equilibrium constant
of si2B. Kinetic evidence favors an associative mechanism of recognition
of the target strand by the double-stranded siRNA. The minimal model
for siRNA-target recognition described here is consistent with the
high biological activity of si2B only if one assumes a step subsequent

abstract = {Many bacterial genes of related function are organized in operons
and transcribed as polycistronic mRNAs to ensure the coordinate expression
of the individual cistrons. Post-transcriptional modulation of such
mRNAs can alter the expression of downstream cistrons, resulting
in discoordinate protein synthesis from an operon mRNA. Several factors,
including small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), have been described that
act collectively as repressors within polycistronic mRNAs. We describe
the first case of discoordinated operon expression in which a downstream
cistron is activated at the post-transcriptional level. We report
that GlmY sRNA activates GlmS synthesis from the Escherichia coli
glmUS mRNA without altering GlmU expression. The sRNA is shown to
be structurally and functionally conserved in diverse enterobacteria;
its transcription may be controlled by the alternative sigma factor,
sigma(54). Our data suggest that Gram-negative bacteria evolved a
mechanism of glmS riboregulation that is distinct from the glmS riboswitch
mechanism of Gram-positive bacteria.},

These biases are (now) consistent with the high percentage of unpaired adenosine nucleotides in several structure motifs.An analysis of a larger set of bacterial comparative 16 S and 23 S rRNA structure models has substantiated this initial finding and revealed new biases in the distribution of adenosine nucleotides in loop regions. The majority of the adenosine nucleotides are unpaired, while the majority of the G, C, and U bases are paired in the covariation-based structure model. The unpaired adenosine nucleotides predominate in the middle and at the 3' end of loops, and are the second most frequent nucleotide type at the 5' end of loops (G is the most common nucleotide). There are additional biases for unpaired adenosine nucleotides at the 3' end of loops and adjacent to a G at the 5' end of the helix. The most prevalent consecutive nucleotides are GG, GA, AG, and AA. A total of 70 {\%} of the GG sequences are within helices, while more than 70 {\%} of the AA sequences are unpaired. Nearly 50 {\%} of the GA sequences are unpaired, and approximately one-third of the AG sequences are within helices while another third are at the 3' loop.5' helix junction.

Ribosomes from Bacillus subtilis, Halobacter halobium, Drosphilia melanogaster, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, mitochondria of M. musculus, H. sapiens and Trypanosoma brucei, and Zea mays chloroplasts were examined, resulting in the exact localization of 190 psi residues. The number of psi residues per RNA varied from one in the mitochondrial RNAs to 57 in the cytoplasmic LSU RNA of D. melanogaster and M. musculus. Despite this, all of the psi residues were found in three domains, II, IV and V. All three are at or have been linked to the peptidyl transferase center according to the literature. Comparison of the sites for psi among the species examined revealed four conserved or semi-conserved segments. One is the region 1911 to 1917, which contains three psi or modified psi in almost all species examined. This site is also juxtaposed to the decoding site of the 30 S subunit in the 70 S ribosome and has been implicated in the fidelity of codon recognition. Three additional sites were at the peptidyl transferase center itself. The juxtaposition of the conserved sites for psi with the two important functions of the ribosome, codon recognition and peptide bond formation, implies an important role for psi in ribosome function. We report some new putative modified nucleosides in LSU RNAs as detected by reverse transcription, correct a segment of the sequence of Z. mays chloroplasts and D. melanogaster LSU RNA, correlate the secondary structural context for all known psi residues in ribosomal RNA, and compare the sites for psi with those known for methylated nucleosides in H. sapiens.},

on chromosome 3 region q21-q23. In contrast to Rab6A whose expression
is ubiquitous, northern blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and
immunofluorescence demonstrated that Rab6B is expressed in a tissue

brain and the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. In brain, Rab6B was
found to be specifically expressed in microglia, pericytes and Purkinje

vesicles. Comparable studies between Rab6A and Rab6B revealed distinct
biochemical and cellular properties. Rab6B displayed lower GTP-binding

RNA with mismatches to a target sequence present in multiple copies

however, silence it by translational repression. Here we report that
a mismatched RNA, targeted to a single site in the coding sequence

repressing translation. The antisense strand of such a mismatched
RNA requires a 5'-phosphate but not a 3'-hydroxyl group. G.U wobble
base pairing is tolerated as a match for both RNA degradation and
translation repression. Together, these findings suggest that a small
inhibitory RNA duplex can suppress expression of off-target cellular
proteins by RNA degradation or translation repression. Proper design
of experimental small inhibitory RNAs or a search for targets of

in general, activity correlated with the activity to RNase H-dependent

that RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides were determined to be active

Here we examine the effect of ectopic RyhB production on global gene expression by microarray analysis. Many of the previously identified targets were found, as well as other mRNAs encoding iron-binding proteins, bringing the total number of regulated operons to at least 18, encoding 56 genes. The two major operons involved in Fe-S cluster assembly showed different behavior; the isc operon appears to be a direct target of RyhB action, while the suf operon does not. This is consistent with previous findings suggesting that the suf genes but not the isc genes are important for Fe-S cluster synthesis under iron-limiting conditions, presumably for essential iron-binding proteins. In addition, we observed repression of Fur-regulated genes upon RyhB expression, interpreted as due to intracellular iron sparing resulting from reduced synthesis of iron-binding proteins. Our results demonstrate the broad effects of a single noncoding RNA on iron homeostasis.},

abstract = {DsrA RNA is a small (87-nucleotide) regulatory RNA of Escherichia
coli that acts by RNA-RNA interactions to control translation and
turnover of specific mRNAs. Two targets of DsrA regulation are RpoS,
the stationary-phase and stress response sigma factor (sigmas), and
H-NS, a histone-like nucleoid protein and global transcription repressor.
Genes regulated globally by RpoS and H-NS include stress response
proteins and virulence factors for pathogenic E. coli. Here, by using
transcription profiling via DNA arrays, we have identified genes
induced by DsrA. Steady-state levels of mRNAs from many genes increased
with DsrA overproduction, including multiple acid resistance genes
of E. coli. Quantitative primer extension analysis verified the induction
of individual acid resistance genes in the hdeAB, gadAX, and gadBC
operons. E. coli K-12 strains, as well as pathogenic E. coli O157:H7,
exhibited compromised acid resistance in dsrA mutants. Conversely,
overproduction of DsrA from a plasmid rendered the acid-sensitive
dsrA mutant extremely acid resistant. Thus, DsrA RNA plays a regulatory
role in acid resistance. Whether DsrA targets acid resistance genes
directly by base pairing or indirectly via perturbation of RpoS and/or
H-NS is not known, but in either event, our results suggest that
DsrA RNA may enhance the virulence of pathogenic E. coli.},

abstract = {SgrR is the first characterized member of a family of bacterial transcription
factors containing an N-terminal DNA binding domain and a C-terminal
solute binding domain. Previously, we reported genetic evidence that
SgrR activates the divergently transcribed gene sgrS, which encodes
a small RNA required for recovery from glucose-phosphate stress.
In this study, we examined the regulation of sgrR expression and
found that SgrR negatively autoregulates its own transcription in
the presence and absence of stress. An SgrR binding site in the sgrR-sgrS
intergenic region is required in vivo for both SgrR-dependent activation
of sgrS and autorepression of sgrR. Purified SgrR binds specifically
to sgrS promoter DNA in vitro; a mutation in the site required for
in vivo activation and autorepression abrogates in vitro SgrR binding.
A plasmid library screen identified clones that alter expression
of a P(sgrS)-lacZ fusion; some act by titrating endogenous SgrR.
The yfdZ gene, encoding a putative aminotransferase, was identified
in this screen; the yfdZ promoter contains an SgrR binding site,
and transcriptional fusions indicate that yfdZ is activated by SgrR.
Clones containing mlc, which encodes a glucose-specific repressor
protein, also downregulate P(sgrS)-lacZ. The mlc clones do not appear
to titrate the SgrR protein, indicating that Mlc affects sgrS expression
by an alternative mechanism.},

abstract = {In a previous bioinformatics-based search for novel small-RNA genes
encoded by the Escherichia coli genome, we identified a region, IS063,
located between the ompN and ydbK genes, that encodes an approximately
100-nucleotide small-RNA transcript. Here we show that the expression
of this small RNA is increased at a low temperature and in minimal
medium. Twenty-two nucleotides at the 5' end of this transcript have
the potential to form base pairs with the leader sequence of the
mRNA encoding the outer membrane protein OmpC. The deletion of IS063
increased the expression of an ompC-luc translational fusion 1.5-
to 2-fold, and a 10-fold overexpression of the small RNA led to a
2- to 3-fold repression of the fusion. Deletion and overexpression
of the IS063 RNA also resulted in increases and decreases, respectively,
in OmpC protein levels. Taken together, these results suggest that
IS063 is a regulator of OmpC expression; thus, the small RNA has
been renamed MicC. The antisense regulation was further demonstrated
by the finding that micC mutations were suppressed by compensatory
mutations in the ompC mRNA. MicC was also shown to inhibit ribosome
binding to the ompC mRNA leader in vitro and to require the Hfq RNA
chaperone for its function. We suggest that the MicF and MicC RNAs
act in conjunction with the EnvZ-OmpR two-component system to control
the OmpF/OmpC protein ratio in response to a variety of environmental
stimuli.},

This revealed four distinct groups of strains containing, respectively, D. hansenii var. hansenii CBS 767(T), D. hansenii var. fabryi CBS 789(T), Candida famata var. flareri CBS 1796(T) (the anamorph of D. hansenii var. fabryi CBS 789(T)) and Debaryomyces tyrocola CBS 766(T), whose species status was no longer accepted. The sequence divergence between these groups, reaching in some cases over 20 {\%}, unambiguously isolated the groups as separate taxa, leading to a proposal for the reinstatement of the originally described species D. hansenii CBS 767(T) and D. tyrocola CBS 766(T). The variety D. hansenii var. fabryi was further subdivided into two taxa, Debaryomyces fabryi CBS 789(T) and Candida flareri CBS 1796(T) (previously C. famata var. flareri and Blastodendrion flareri). The comparison of intron sequences therefore exposed cryptic species whose phenotypic traits are not distinguishable from known species, but which have significantly diverged from the genetic point of view. Hence, we describe the new taxon Debaryomyces macquariensis sp. nov. CBS 5571(T) is related to, but clearly distinct from, the Debaryomyces species mentioned above. The approach used in this work has also revealed the existence of populations within the newly delineated species D. hansenii and genetic exchanges between these populations, indicating an unexpected genetic diversity within this part of the genus Debaryomyces.},

Although extinction has been incessant at lower taxonomic levels, genomic comparisons among surviving members of higher taxa suggest that much of the developmental systems that pattern their bodyplans has been conserved from early in their history. Comparisons between the origin of morphological disparity in the record and patterns of genomic disparity among living taxa promise to be interesting. For example, Hox cluster composition varies among major taxa, and the fossil record suggests that many of the changes in Hox clusters may have been associated with late Neoproterozoic evolution among minute benthic vermiform clades, from which crown bilaterian phyla arose just before or during the Cambrian explosion. Study of genomic differences among crown classes and orders whosetiming and mode of origin can be inferred from morphological data inthefossil record should throw further light on the timing and mode of origin of genomic disparities.},

abstract = {Hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms are ubiquitously distributed in soil and aquatic environments. Populations of hydrocarbon-degraders normally constitute less than 1{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of the total microbial communities, but when oil pollutants are present these hydrocarbon-degrading populations increase, typically to 10{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of the community. With regard to rates of natural degradation, these typically have been found to be low and limited by environmental factors. Rates reported for pristine marine waters typically are less than 0{\{}{\textperiodcentered}{\}}03 g/m3/day. In adapted communities rates of hydrocarbon degradation of 0{\{}{\textperiodcentered}{\}}5–50 g/m3/day have been reported. Bioremediation tries to raise the rates of degradation found naturally to significantly higher rates. The two general approaches that have been tested for the bioremediation of marine oil spills are the application of fertilizer to enhance the abilities of the indigenous hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria and the addition of naturally occurring adapted microbial hydrocarbon-degraders by seeding. Bioremediation, accomplished by the application of fertilizer to enhance the abilities of the indigenous hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria, was successfully applied for the treatment of the 1989 Alaskan oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Seeding with adapted nonindigenous microbial hydrocarbon degraders was tested on smaller spills in Texas—such as the Mega Borg spill—but bioremediation to remove petroleum pollutants by seeding has yet to be demonstrated as efficacious in field trials. The spill of more than 200,000 barrels of crude oil from the oil tanker Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound, Alaska, as well as smaller spills in Texas—such as the Mega Borg spill—have been treated by bioremediation to remove petroleum pollutants. The Exxon Valdez spill formed the basis for a major study on bioremediation through fertilizer application and the largest application of this emerging technology. Three types of nutrient supplementation were tested: water-soluble (23:2 N:P garden fertilizer formulation): slow-release (Customblen); and oleophilic (Inipol EAP 22). Each fertilizer was tested in laboratory simulations and in field demonstration plots to determine the efficacy of nutrient supplementation. The use of Inipol EAP22 (oleophilic microemulsion with urea as a nitrogen source, laureth phosphate as a phosphate source, and oleic acid as a carbon source) and Customblen (slow-release calcium phosphate, ammonium phosphate, and ammonium nitrate within a polymerized vegetable oil coating) was approved for shoreline treatment and was used as a major part of the cleanup effort. Multiple regression models showed that nitrogen applications were effective in stimulating the rates of biodegradation.},

In the laboratory scale treatment (starting concentration 3500 mg kg−1, sum of 16 PAH) the high molecular weight PAHs were degraded significantly more in the fungal-inoculated microcosms than in the uninoculated ones. In the microcosms inoculated with Phanerochaete velutina, 96{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of 4-ring PAHs and 39{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of 5- and 6-ring PAHs were removed in three months. In the uninoculated microcosms, 55{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of 4-ring PAHs and only 7{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of 5- and 6-ring PAHs were degraded. However, during the field scale (2 t) experiment at lower starting concentration (1400 mg kg−1, sum of 16 PAH) the {\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} degradation was similar in both the P. velutina-inoculated and the uninoculated treatments: 94{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of the 16 PAHs were degraded in three months. In the field scale experiment the copy number of gram-positive bacteria PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase genes was found to increase 1000 fold, indicating that bacterial PAH degradation also played an important role.},

abstract = {Small nucleolar RNAs constitute a family of newly discovered non-coding small RNAs, most of which function in guiding RNA modifications. Two prevalent types of modifications are 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation. The modification is directed by the formation of a canonical small nucleolar RNA-target duplex. Initially, RNA-guided modification was shown to take place on rRNA, but recent studies suggest that small nuclear RNA, mRNA, tRNA, and the trypanosome spliced leader RNA also undergo guided modifications. Trypanosomes contain more modifications and potentially more small nucleolar RNAs than yeast, and the increased number of modifications may help to preserve ribosome function under adverse environmental conditions during the cycling between the insect and mammalian host. The genome organisation in clusters carrying the two types of small nucleolar RNAs, C/D and H/ACA-like RNAs, resembles that in plants. However, the trypanosomatid H/ACA RNAs are similar to those found in Archaea and are composed of a single hairpin that may represent the primordial H/ACA RNA. In this review we summarise this new field of trypanosome small nucleolar RNAs, emphasising the open questions regarding the number of small nucleolar RNAs, the repertoire, genome organisation, and the unique function of guided modifications in these protozoan parasites.},

abstract = {The secretion of bacterial toxin proteins is achieved by dedicated machineries called secretion systems. The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread versatile machine used for the delivery of protein toxins to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the expression of the T6SS genes is activated during macrophage or mouse infection. Here, we show that the T6SS gene cluster is silenced by the histone-like nucleoid structuring H-NS protein using a combination of reporter fusions, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, DNase footprinting, and fluorescence microscopy. We further demonstrate that derepression of the S. Typhimurium T6SS genes induces T6SS-dependent intoxication of competing bacteria. Our results suggest that relieving T6SS H-NS silencing may be used as a sense-and-kill mechanism that will help S. Typhimurium to homogenize and synchronize the microbial population to gain efficiency during infection.},

abstract = {Candida biofilms formed on indwelling medical devices are increasingly associated with severe infections. In this study, we used proteomics and Western and Northern blotting analyses to demonstrate that alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is downregulated in Candida biofilms. Disruption of ADH1 significantly (P = 0.0046) enhanced the ability of Candida albicans to form biofilm. Confocal scanning laser microscopy showed that the adh1 mutant formed thicker biofilm than the parent strain (210 microm and 140 microm, respectively). These observations were extended to an engineered human oral mucosa and an in vivo rat model of catheter-associated biofilm. Inhibition of Candida ADH enzyme using disulfiram and 4-methylpyrazole resulted in thicker biofilm (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.05). Moreover, biofilms formed by the adh1 mutant strain produced significantly smaller amounts of ethanol, but larger amounts of acetaldehyde, than biofilms formed by the parent and revertant strains (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.0001), demonstrating that the effect of Adh1p on biofilm formation is mediated by its enzymatic activity. Furthermore, we found that 10{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} ethanol significantly inhibited biofilm formation in vitro, with complete inhibition of biofilm formation at ethanol concentrations of {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}/=20{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}. Similarly, using a clinically relevant rabbit model of catheter-associated biofilm, we found that ethanol treatment inhibited biofilm formation by C. albicans in vivo (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.05) but not by Staphylococcus spp. (P {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 0.05), indicating that ethanol specifically inhibits Candida biofilm formation. Taken together, our studies revealed that Adh1p contributes to the ability of C. albicans to form biofilms in vitro and in vivo and that the protein restricts biofilm formation through an ethanol-dependent mechanism. These results are clinically relevant and may suggest novel antibiofilm treatment strategies.},

Melanin is thought to contribute to the virulence of E. dermatitidis. Whereas the synthesis and the redox properties of melanin have been studied intensively, the influence of melanin and carotenoids on the phagocytosis, the oxidative burst, and the killing of E. dermatitidis by human neutrophils has not been studied. To study their effects on these phenomena, we applied a combination of flow cytometry and a colony-count-dependent method. Using E. dermatitidis wild-type strain 8565 and several melanin-deficient mutants that have been described previously, we demonstrate that melanin prevents this pathogen from being killed in the phagolysosome of the neutrophils. Melanin did not influence the phagocytosis or the oxidative burst of the neutrophils involved. The carotenoids torulene and torularhodine were not found to contribute to the prevention of killing. The ability of E. dermatitidis to block the effects of the neutrophil oxidative burst may critically impair the potential of the host to sufficiently eliminate this fungal pathogen and thus may play an important role in the pathogenesis of phaeohyphomycosis.},

We have recently demonstrated that the ATP-dependent Lon protease of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium negatively regulates the efficiency of invasion of epithelial cells and the expression of invasion genes (A. Takaya et al., J. Bacteriol. 184:224-232, 2002). This study was performed to reveal the contribution of the Lon protease to the virulence of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in mice. Determination of 50{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} lethal doses for the lon disruption mutant and wild-type strain revealed that the mutant was highly attenuated when administered either orally or intraperitoneally to BALB/c mice. The mutant was also found to be able to reach extraintestinal sites but unable to proliferate efficiently within the spleen and cause lethal systemic disease of mice. Macrophage survival assays revealed that the lon disruption mutant could not survive or proliferate within murine macrophages. In addition, the mutant showed extremely increased susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide, which contributes to the bactericidal capacity of phagocytes. The mutant also showed increased sensitivity to acidic conditions. Taken together, the impaired ability of the lon disruption mutant to survive and grow in macrophages could be due to the enhanced susceptibility to the oxygen-dependent killing mechanism associated with respiratory burst and the low phagosomal pH. These results suggest that the Lon protease is essentially involved in the systemic infection of mice with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, which can be fatal. Of further interest is the finding that the lon disruption mutant persists in the BALB/c mice for long periods without causing an overwhelming systemic infection.},

abstract = {Gene-encoded anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) are widespread in nature, as they are synthesized by microorganisms as well as by multicellular organisms from both the vegetal and the animal kingdoms. These naturally occurring AMPs form a first line of host defense against pathogens and are involved in innate immunity. Depending on their tissue distribution, AMPs ensure either a systemic or a local protection of the organism against environmental pathogens. They are classified into three major groups: (i) peptides with an alpha-helical conformation (insect cecropins, magainins, etc.), (ii) cyclic and open-ended cyclic peptides with pairs of cysteine residues (defensins, protegrin, etc.), and (iii) peptides with an over-representation of some amino acids (proline rich, histidine rich, etc.). Most AMPs display hydrophobic and cationic properties, have a molecular mass below 25-30 kDa, and adopt an amphipathic structure (alpha-helix, beta-hairpin-like beta-sheet, beta-sheet, or alpha-helix/beta-sheet mixed structures) that is believed to be essential to their anti-microbial action. Interestingly, in recent years, a series of novel AMPs have been discovered as processed forms of large proteins. Despite the extreme diversity in their primary and secondary structures, all natural AMPs have the in vitro particularity to affect a large number of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, yeast, virus, etc.) with identical or complementary activity spectra. This review focuses on AMPs forming alpha-helices, beta-hairpin-like beta-sheets, beta-sheets, or alpha-helix/beta-sheet mixed structures from invertebrate and vertebrate origins. These molecules show some promise for therapeutic use.},

abstract = {Structural characteristics are essential for the functioning of many noncoding RNAs and cis-regulatory elements of mRNAs. SNPs may disrupt these structures, interfere with their molecular function, and hence cause a phenotypic effect. RNA folding algorithms can provide detailed insights into structural effects of SNPs. The global measures employed so far suffer from limited accuracy of folding programs on large RNAs and are computationally too demanding for genome-wide applications. Here, we present a strategy that focuses on the local regions of maximal structural change between mutant and wild-type. These local regions are approximated in a "screening mode" that is intended for genome-wide applications. Furthermore, localized regions are identified as those with maximal discrepancy. The mutation effects are quantified in terms of empirical P values. To this end, the RNAsnp software uses extensive precomputed tables of the distribution of SNP effects as function of length and GC content. RNAsnp thus achieves both a noise reduction and speed-up of several orders of magnitude over shuffling-based approaches. On a data set comprising 501 SNPs associated with human-inherited diseases, we predict 54 to have significant local structural effect in the untranslated region of mRNAs.},

abstract = {The term non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is commonly employed for RNA that
does not encode a protein, but this does not mean that such RNAs
do not contain information nor have function. Although it has been
generally assumed that most genetic information is transacted by
proteins, recent evidence suggests that the majority of the genomes
of mammals and other complex organisms is in fact transcribed into
ncRNAs, many of which are alternatively spliced and/or processed
into smaller products. These ncRNAs include microRNAs and snoRNAs
(many if not most of which remain to be identified), as well as likely
other classes of yet-to-be-discovered small regulatory RNAs, and
tens of thousands of longer transcripts (including complex patterns
of interlacing and overlapping sense and antisense transcripts),
most of whose functions are unknown. These RNAs (including those
derived from introns) appear to comprise a hidden layer of internal
signals that control various levels of gene expression in physiology
and development, including chromatin architecture/epigenetic memory,
transcription, RNA splicing, editing, translation and turnover. RNA
regulatory networks may determine most of our complex characteristics,
play a significant role in disease and constitute an unexplored world
of genetic variation both within and between species.},

abstract = {In an attempt both to catalogue 3' regulatory region (3' RR)-mediated
disease and to improve our understanding of the structure and function
of the 3' RR, we have performed a systematic analysis of disease-associated
variants in the 3' RRs of human protein-coding genes. We have previously
analysed the variants that have occurred in two specific domains/motifs
of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) as well as in the 3' flanking
region. Here we have focused upon 83 known variants within the upstream
sequence (USS; between the translational termination codon and the
upstream core polyadenylation signal sequence) of the 3' UTR. To
place these variants in their proper context, we first performed
a comprehensive survey of known cis-regulatory elements within the
USS and the mechanisms by which they effect post-transcriptional
gene regulation. Although this survey supports the view that RNA
regulatory elements function within the context of specific secondary
structures, there are no general rules governing how secondary structure
might exert its influence. We have therefore addressed this question
by systematically evaluating both functional and non-functional (based
upon in vitro reporter gene and/or electrophoretic mobility shift
assay data) USS variant-containing sequences against known cis-regulatory
motifs within the context of predicted RNA secondary structures.
This has allowed us not only to establish a reliable and objective
means to perform secondary structure prediction but also to identify
consistent patterns of secondary structural change that could potentiate
the discrimination of functional USS variants from their non-functional
counterparts. The resulting rules were then used to infer potential
functionality in the case of some of the remaining functionally uncharacterised
USS variants, from their predicted secondary structures. This not
only led us to identify further patterns of secondary structural
change but also several potential novel cis-regulatory motifs within
the 3' UTRs studied.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The process of generating raw genome sequence data continues to become cheaper, faster, and more accurate. However, assembly of such data into high-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging. Many genome assembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in terms of their performance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements, acceptance of newer read technologies) and in their final output (composition of assembled sequence). More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess the quality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are intended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly.

RESULTS: In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be assembled for three vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This resulted in a total of 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating teams. We evaluated these assemblies using a combination of optical map data, Fosmid sequences, and several statistical methods. From over 100 different metrics, we chose ten key measures by which to assess the overall quality of the assemblies.

CONCLUSIONS: Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies, containing a significant representation of their genes and overall genome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the entries suggests that there is still much room for improvement in the field of genome assembly and that approaches which work well in assembling the genome of one species may not necessarily work well for another.},

In contrast, as revealed by recent genomic and RNomic studies, their genomic organization and expression strategies are the most varied. Seemingly snoRNA coding units have adopted, in the course of evolution, all the possible ways of being transcribed, thus providing a unique paradigm of gene expression flexibility. By focusing on representative fungal, plant and animal genomes, we review here all the documented types of snoRNA gene organization and expression, and we provide a comprehensive account of snoRNA expressional freedom by precisely estimating the frequency, in each genome, of each type of genomic organization. We finally discuss the relevance of snoRNA genomic studies for our general understanding of ncRNA family evolution and expression in eukaryotes.},

Two exceptions were an unprocessed pseudogene and a bona fide lncRNA gene, both with open reading frames (ORFs) compromised by upstream stop codons. All potentially translatable lncRNA ORFs had only a single peptide match, indicating low protein abundance and/or false-positive peptide matches.

abstract = {The identification of orthologous groups is useful for genome annotation, studies on gene/protein evolution, comparative genomics, and the identification of taxonomically restricted sequences. Methods successfully exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group (putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved recognition of "recent" paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human, fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). Analysis of clusters incorporating P. falciparum genes identifies numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation of the parasite genome.},

However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Using the same model as the successful Assemblathon competitions we organized a competitive evaluation in which teams submitted their alignments and then assessments were performed collectively after all the submissions were received. Three datasets were used; two were simulated and based on primate and mammalian phylogenies and one was comprised of 20 real fly genomes. In total 35 submissions were assessed, submitted by ten teams using 12 different alignment pipelines. We found agreement between independent simulation-based and statistical assessments indicating that there are substantial accuracy differences between contemporary alignment tools. We saw considerable difference in the alignment quality of differently annotated regions and found few tools aligned the duplications analysed. We found many tools worked well at shorter evolutionary distances, but fewer performed competitively at longer distances.

abstract = {We present an integrative approach, SeqFold, that combines high-throughput RNA structure profiling data with computational prediction for genome-scale reconstruction of RNA secondary structures. SeqFold transforms experimental RNA structure information into a structure preference profile (SPP) and uses it to select stable RNA structure candidates representing the structure ensemble. Under a high-dimensional classification framework, SeqFold efficiently matches a given SPP to the most likely cluster of structures sampled from the Boltzmann-weighted ensemble. SeqFold is able to incorporate diverse types of RNA structure profiling data, including parallel analysis of RNA structure (PARS), selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq), fragmentation sequencing (FragSeq) data generated by deep sequencing, and conventional SHAPE data. Using the known structures of a wide range of mRNAs and noncoding RNAs as benchmarks, we demonstrate that SeqFold outperforms or matches existing approaches in accuracy and is more robust to noise in experimental data. Application of SeqFold to reconstruct the secondary structures of the yeast transcriptome reveals the diverse impact of RNA secondary structure on gene regulation, including translation efficiency, transcription initiation, and protein-RNA interactions. SeqFold can be easily adapted to incorporate any new types of high-throughput RNA structure profiling data and is widely applicable to analyze RNA structures in any transcriptome.},

abstract = {Diversification of mammalian species began more than 160 million years ago when the egg-laying monotremes diverged from live bearing mammals. The duck-billed platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) and echidnas are the only potential contemporary witnesses of this period and, thereby, provide a unique insight into mammalian genome evolution. It has become clear that small RNAs are major regulatory agents in eukaryotic cells, and the significant role of non-protein-coding (npc) RNAs in transcription, processing, and translation is now well accepted. Here we show that the platypus genome contains more than 200 small nucleolar (sno) RNAs among hundreds of other diverse npcRNAs. Their comparison among key mammalian groups and other vertebrates enabled us to reconstruct a complete temporal pathway of acquisition and loss of these snoRNAs. In platypus we found cis- and trans-duplication distribution patterns for snoRNAs, which have not been described in any other vertebrates but are known to occur in nematodes. An exciting novelty in platypus is a snoRNA-derived retroposon (termed snoRTE) that facilitates a very effective dispersal of an H/ACA snoRNA via RTE-mediated retroposition. From more than 40,000 detected full-length and truncated genomic copies of this snoRTE, at least 21 are processed into mature snoRNAs. High-copy retroposition via multiple host gene-promoted transcription units is a novel pathway for combining housekeeping function and SINE-like dispersal and reveals a new dimension in the evolution of novel snoRNA function.},

abstract = {Various new methods have been proposed to predict functional interactions between proteins based on the genomic context of their genes. The types of genomic context that they use are Type I: the fusion of genes; Type II: the conservation of gene-order or co-occurrence of genes in potential operons; and Type III: the co-occurrence of genes across genomes (phylogenetic profiles). Here we compare these types for their coverage, their correlations with various types of functional interaction, and their overlap with homology-based function assignment. We apply the methods to Mycoplasma genitalium, the standard benchmarking genome in computational and experimental genomics. Quantitatively, conservation of gene order is the technique with the highest coverage, applying to 37{\%} of the genes. By combining gene order conservation with gene fusion (6{\%}), the co-occurrence of genes in operons in absence of gene order conservation (8{\%}), and the co-occurrence of genes across genomes (11{\%}), significant context information can be obtained for 50{\%} of the genes (the categories overlap). Qualitatively, we observe that the functional interactions between genes are stronger as the requirements for physical neighborhood on the genome are more stringent, while the fraction of potential false positives decreases. Moreover, only in cases in which gene order is conserved in a substantial fraction of the genomes, in this case six out of twenty-five, does a single type of functional interaction (physical interaction) clearly dominate ({\textgreater}80{\%}). In other cases, complementary function information from homology searches, which is available for most of the genes with significant genomic context, is essential to predict the type of interaction. Using a combination of genomic context and homology searches, new functional features can be predicted for 10{\%} of M. genitalium genes.},

gene silencing mediated by double-stranded RNA. RNAi has recently
emerged as a powerful genetic tool to analyze gene function in mammalian

in predicting the efficacy of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in
silencing a gene. This has imposed serious limitations not only for
small-scale but also for high-throughput RNAi screening initiatives
in mammalian systems. We have developed a reliable and quantitative
approach for the rapid and efficient identification of the most effective
siRNA against any gene. The efficacy of siRNA sequences is monitored
by their ability to reduce the expression of cognate target-reporter
fusions with easily quantified readouts. Finally, using micro array-based
cell transfections, we demonstrate an unlimited potential of this
approach in high-throughput screens for identifying effective siRNA
probes for silencing genes in mammalian systems. This approach is
likely to have implications in the use of RNAi as a reverse genetic
tool for analyzing mammalian gene function on a genome-wide scale.},

abstract = {Functional RNA structures play an important role both in the context
of noncoding RNA transcripts as well as regulatory elements in mRNAs.
Here we present a computational study to detect functional RNA structures
within the ENCODE regions of the human genome. Since structural RNAs
in general lack characteristic signals in primary sequence, comparative
approaches evaluating evolutionary conservation of structures are
most promising. We have used three recently introduced programs based
on either phylogenetic-stochastic context-free grammar (EvoFold)
or energy directed folding (RNAz and AlifoldZ), yielding several
thousand candidate structures (corresponding to approximately 2.7{\%}
of the ENCODE regions). EvoFold has its highest sensitivity in highly
conserved and relatively AU-rich regions, while RNAz favors slightly
GC-rich regions, resulting in a relatively small overlap between
methods. Comparison with the GENCODE annotation points to functional
RNAs in all genomic contexts, with a slightly increased density in
3'-UTRs. While we estimate a significant false discovery rate of
approximately 50{\%}-70{\%} many of the predictions can be further substantiated
by additional criteria: 248 loci are predicted by both RNAz and EvoFold,
and an additional 239 RNAz or EvoFold predictions are supported by
the (more stringent) AlifoldZ algorithm. Five hundred seventy RNAz
structure predictions fall into regions that show signs of selection
pressure also on the sequence level (i.e., conserved elements). More
than 700 predictions overlap with noncoding transcripts detected
by oligonucleotide tiling arrays. One hundred seventy-five selected
candidates were tested by RT-PCR in six tissues, and expression could
be verified in 43 cases (24.6{\%}).},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair to sites in mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. Many sites that match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2-7), particularly those in 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs), are preferentially conserved. Here, we overhauled our tool for finding preferential conservation of sequence motifs and applied it to the analysis of human 3'UTRs, increasing by nearly threefold the detected number of preferentially conserved miRNA target sites. The new tool more efficiently incorporates new genomes and more completely controls for background conservation by accounting for mutational biases, dinucleotide conservation rates, and the conservation rates of individual UTRs. The improved background model enabled preferential conservation of a new site type, the "offset 6mer," to be detected. In total, {\textgreater}45,000 miRNA target sites within human 3'UTRs are conserved above background levels, and {\textgreater}60{\%} of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs have far fewer conserved targets than do the more broadly conserved miRNAs, even when considering only more recently emerged targets. Although pairing to the 3' end of miRNAs can compensate for seed mismatches, this class of sites constitutes less than 2{\%} of all preferentially conserved sites detected. The new tool enables statistically powerful analysis of individual miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially conserved targeting (P(CT)) correlating with experimental measurements of repression. Our expanded set of target predictions (including conserved 3'-compensatory sites), are available at the TargetScan website, which displays the P(CT) for each site and each predicted target.},

These include the maturation of tRNA molecules via the trans-splicing of tRNA halves and genomic rearrangements to compensate for the absence of RNase P.

RESULTS: Here, the RNA processing events in the N. equitans cell are analyzed using RNA-Seq deep sequencing methodology. All tRNA half precursor and tRNA termini were determined and support the tRNA trans-splicing model. The processing of CRISPR RNAs from two CRISPR clusters was verified. Twenty-seven C/D box small RNAs (sRNAs) and a H/ACA box sRNA were identified. The C/D box sRNAs were found to flank split genes, to form dicistronic tRNA-sRNA precursors and to be encoded within the tRNAMet intron.

CONCLUSIONS: The presented data provide an overview of the production and usage of small RNAs in a cell that has to survive with a highly reduced genome. N. equitans lost many essential metabolic pathways but maintains highly active CRISPR/Cas and rRNA modification systems that appear to play an important role in genome fragmentation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In many prokaryotes, transcription of DNA to RNA is terminated by a thymine-rich stretch of DNA following a hairpin loop. Detecting such Rho-independent transcription terminators can shed light on the organization of bacterial genomes and can improve genome annotation. Previous computational methods to predict Rho-independent terminators have been slow or limited in the organisms they consider. RESULTS: We describe TransTermHP, a new computational method to rapidly and accurately detect Rho-independent transcription terminators. We predict the locations of terminators in 343 prokaryotic genomes, representing the largest collection of predictions available. In Bacillus subtilis, we can detect 93{\%} of known terminators with a false positive rate of just 6{\%}, comparable to the best-known methods. Outside the Firmicutes division, we find that Rho-independent termination plays a large role in the Neisseria and Vibrio genera, the Pasteurellaceae (including the Haemophilus genus) and several other species. In Neisseria and Pasteurellaceae, terminator hairpins are frequently formed by closely spaced, complementary instances of exogenous DNA uptake signal sequences. We quantify the propensity for terminators to include these sequences. In the process, we provide the first discussion of potential uptake signals in Haemophilus ducreyi and Mannheimia succiniciproducens, and we discuss the preference for a particular configuration of uptake signal sequences within terminators. CONCLUSION: Our new fast and accurate method for detecting transcription terminators has allowed us to identify and analyze terminators in many new genomes and to identify DNA uptake signal sequences in several species where they have not been previously reported. Our software and predictions are freely available.},

@article{Lai:03,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of 21-22 nucleotide
non-coding RNAs with presumed post-transcriptional regulatory activity.
Most miRNAs were identified by direct cloning of small RNAs, an approach
that favors detection of abundant miRNAs. Three observations suggested
that miRNA genes might be identified using a computational approach.
First, miRNAs generally derive from precursor transcripts of 70-100
nucleotides with extended stem-loop structure. Second, miRNAs are
usually highly conserved between the genomes of related species.
Third, miRNAs display a characteristic pattern of evolutionary divergence.
RESULTS: We developed an informatic procedure called 'miRseeker',
which analyzed the completed euchromatic sequences of Drosophila
melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura for conserved sequences that adopt
an extended stem-loop structure and display a pattern of nucleotide
divergence characteristic of known miRNAs. The sensitivity of this
computational procedure was demonstrated by the presence of 75{\%} (18/24)
of previously identified Drosophila miRNAs within the top 124 candidates.
In total, we identified 48 novel miRNA candidates that were strongly
conserved in more distant insect, nematode, or vertebrate genomes.
We verified expression for a total of 24 novel miRNA genes, including
20 of 27 candidates conserved in a third species and 4 of 11 high-scoring,
Drosophila-specific candidates. Our analyses lead us to estimate
that drosophilid genomes contain around 110 miRNA genes. CONCLUSIONS:
Our computational strategy succeeded in identifying bona fide miRNA
genes and suggests that miRNAs constitute nearly 1{\%} of predicted
protein-coding genes in Drosophila, a percentage similar to the percentage
of miRNAs recently attributed to other metazoan genomes.},

@article{Enright:03,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent discoveries of microRNA (miRNA) genes and
characterization of the first few target genes regulated by miRNAs
in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have set the
stage for elucidation of a novel network of regulatory control. We
present a computational method for whole-genome prediction of miRNA
target genes. The method is validated using known examples. For each
miRNA, target genes are selected on the basis of three properties:
sequence complementarity using a position-weighted local alignment
algorithm, free energies of RNA-RNA duplexes, and conservation of
target sites in related genomes. Application to the D. melanogaster,
Drosophila pseudoobscura and Anopheles gambiae genomes identifies
several hundred target genes potentially regulated by one or more
known miRNAs. RESULTS: These potential targets are rich in genes
that are expressed at specific developmental stages and that are
involved in cell fate specification, morphogenesis and the coordination
of developmental processes, as well as genes that are active in the
mature nervous system. High-ranking target genes are enriched in
transcription factors two-fold and include genes already known to
be under translational regulation. Our results reaffirm the thesis
that miRNAs have an important role in establishing the complex spatial
and temporal patterns of gene activity necessary for the orderly
progression of development and suggest additional roles in the function
of the mature organism. In addition the results point the way to
directed experiments to determine miRNA functions. CONCLUSIONS: The
emerging combinatorics of miRNA target sites in the 3' untranslated
regions of messenger RNAs are reminiscent of transcriptional regulation
in promoter regions of DNA, with both one-to-many and many-to-one
relationships between regulator and target. Typically, more than
one miRNA regulates one message, indicative of cooperative translational
control. Conversely, one miRNA may have several target genes, reflecting
target multiplicity. As a guide to focused experiments, we provide
detailed online information about likely target genes and binding
sites in their untranslated regions, organized by miRNA or by gene
and ranked by likelihood of match. The target prediction algorithm
is freely available and can be applied to whole genome sequences
using identified miRNA sequences.},

abstract = {A hallmark of many neoplasias is chromosomal rearrangement, an event that commonly results in the fusion of two separate genes. The RNA and protein resulting from these gene fusions often play critical roles in cancer development, maintenance, and progression. Traditionally, these fusion products are thought to be produced solely due to DNA level changes and are therefore considered unique to cancer. Recent advances in microarray and deep-sequencing have revealed many more fusion transcripts. Surprisingly, some are without detectable rearrangement at the DNA level. Reports have demonstrated that at least some of these chimeric RNAs are generated via intergenic splicing. In this review, we highlight three examples of these noncanonical chimeric transcripts that are formed by trans-splicing or cis-splicing of adjacent genes and summarize the knowledge we have regarding these noncanonical fusions. We discuss the implications of the chimeric RNAs in both cancer and normal physiology, as some of these fusion transcripts are found in normal, noncancerous cells with sequences identical to those generated by canonical chromosomal translocation found in cancer cells. Finally, we present methods that are currently being used to discover additional chimeric RNAs.},

obscure, even though the 109-nucleotide RNA was discovered almost
three decades ago. Structural features of Spot 42 RNA and previous
work suggested to us that the RNA might be a regulator of discoordinate
gene expression of the galactose operon, a control that is only understood
at the phenomenological level. The effects of controlled expression
of Spot 42 RNA or deleting the gene (spf) encoding the RNA supported
this hypothesis. Down-regulation of galK expression, the third gene
in the gal operon, was only observed in the presence of Spot 42 RNA
and required growth conditions that caused derepression of the spf
gene. Subsequent biochemical studies showed that Spot 42 RNA specifically
bound at the galK Shine-Dalgarno region of the galETKM mRNA, thereby
blocking ribosome binding. We conclude that Spot 42 RNA is an antisense
RNA that acts to differentially regulate genes that are expressed
from the same transcription unit. Our results reveal an interesting
mechanism by which the expression of a promoter distal gene in an
operon can be modulated and underline the importance of antisense
control in bacterial gene regulation.},

abstract = {RNAIII is the intracellular effector of the quorum-sensing system in Staphylococcus aureus. It is one of the largest regulatory RNAs (514 nucleotides long) that are known to control the expression of a large number of virulence genes. Here, we show that the 3' domain of RNAIII coordinately represses at the post-transcriptional level, the expression of mRNAs that encode a class of virulence factors that act early in the infection process. We demonstrate that the 3' domain acts primarily as an antisense RNA and rapidly anneals to these mRNAs, forming long RNA duplexes. The interaction between RNAIII and the mRNAs results in repression of translation initiation and triggers endoribonuclease III hydrolysis. These processes are followed by rapid depletion of the mRNA pool. In addition, we show that RNAIII and its 3' domain mediate translational repression of rot mRNA through a limited number of base pairings involving two loop-loop interactions. Since Rot is a transcriptional regulatory protein, we proposed that RNAIII indirectly acts on many downstream genes, resulting in the activation of the synthesis of several exoproteins. These data emphasize the multitude of regulatory steps affected by RNAIII and its 3' domain in establishing a network of S. aureus virulence factors.},

Cleavage proceeds via hydrolysis and the release of a 3'-hydroxyl

at the cleavage site by 2'-deoxy had no significant effect, suggesting
that product release and/or a conformational transition rather than
a chemical step is rate-limiting. Substitution by 2'-O-methyl at
the cleavage site substantially reduced cleavage, which is presumably
due to steric interference. Mutational analysis of the target RNA
revealed that mismatches across from the 5' or the 3' end of the
siRNA had little effect and that substrate RNAs as short as 15 nucleotides

abstract = {RyhB is a small antisense regulatory RNA that is repressed by the Fur repressor and negatively regulates at least six mRNAs encoding Fe-binding or Fe-storage proteins in Escherichia coli. When Fe is limiting, RyhB levels rise, and target mRNAs are rapidly degraded. RyhB is very stable when measured after treatment of cells with the transcription inhibitor rifampicin, but is unstable when overall mRNA transcription continues. We propose that RyhB turnover is coupled to and dependent on pairing with the target mRNAs. Degradation of both mRNA targets and RyhB is dependent on RNase E and is slowed in degradosome mutants. RyhB requires the RNA chaperone Hfq. In the absence of Hfq, RyhB is unstable, even when general transcription is inhibited; degradation is dependent upon RNase E. Hfq and RNase E bind similar sites on the RNA; pairing may allow loss of Hfq and access by RNase E. Two other Hfq-dependent small RNAs, DsrA and OxyS, are also stable when overall transcription is off, and unstable when it is not, suggesting that they, too, are degraded when their target mRNAs are available for pairing.

abstract = {A new paradigm of gene expression regulation has emerged recently
with the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs). Most, if not all, miRNAs
are thought to control gene expression, mostly by base pairing with
miRNA-recognition elements (MREs) found in their messenger RNA (mRNA)
targets. Although a large number of human miRNAs have been reported,
many of their mRNA targets remain unknown. Here we used a combined
bioinformatics and experimental approach to identify important rules
governing miRNA-MRE recognition that allow prediction of human miRNA
targets. We describe a computational program, {\#}DIANA-microT{\#}, that
identifies mRNA targets for animal miRNAs and predicts mRNA targets,
bearing single MREs, for human and mouse miRNAs.},

regulate the expression of protein-coding genes in plants and animals.
In the present study, we describe a computational procedure to identify
miRNA genes conserved in more than one genome. Applying this program,
known as MiRscan, together with molecular identification and validation
methods, we have identified most of the miRNA genes in the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans. The total number of validated miRNA genes
stands at 88, with no more than 35 genes remaining to be detected
or validated. These 88 miRNA genes represent 48 gene families; 46
of these families (comprising 86 of the 88 genes) are conserved in
Caenorhabditis briggsae, and 22 families are conserved in humans.
More than a third of the worm miRNAs, including newly identified
members of the lin-4 and let-7 gene families, are differentially
expressed during larval development, suggesting a role for these
miRNAs in mediating larval developmental transitions. Most are present
at very high steady-state levels-more than 1000 molecules per cell,
with some exceeding 50,000 molecules per cell. Our census of the
worm miRNAs and their expression patterns helps define this class
of noncoding RNAs, lays the groundwork for functional studies, and
provides the tools for more comprehensive analyses of miRNA genes
in other species.},

test for the impact of a particular structural feature on the binding

extended to describing the effects of hybridizing small "modifier

illustrate the applicability of our approach by quantitatively describing
the interaction of the mRNA stabilizing protein HuR with AU-rich
elements. We discuss our model and recent experimental findings demonstrating
the effectivity of modifier RNAs in vitro in the context of the current
research activities in the field of non-coding RNAs. We speculate
that modifier RNAs might also exist in nature; if so, they present
an additional regulatory layer for fine-tuning gene expression that

abstract = {Analysis of the huge volume of data generated by large scale sequencing projects requires the construction of new, sophisticated computer systems. These systems should be able to manage the biological data as well as the results of their analysis. They should also help the user to choose the most appropriate methods, and to string them together in order to solve a global analysis task. In this paper we present the prototype of a software system providing an environment for the analysis of large-scale sequence data. As a first step toward this end, this environment has been put to the test within the Bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project. This system integrates both the descriptive knowledge of the entities involved (genes, regulatory signals and the like) and the methodological knowledge comprising an extensible set of analytical methods. A knowledge representation based on two existing object-oriented models is used to implement this integrated system. In addition, the present prototype provides a suitable user interface both for displaying simultaneously the results generated by several methods and for interacting with the objects. We present in this paper the analysis of a B. subtilis genome fragment, present in data libraries but not annotated. Annotation of the genes present in the fragment allowed us to combine the results of several methods used for predicting coding sequences, and to characterize it as comprising a cryptic phage, the skin element. Comparison between the annotation of the skin element and a standard region of the chromosome indicated that local features of the nucleotide sequence could discriminate between phage and non-phage DNA sequence.},

@article{Nakamoto2009a,
abstract = {The main mechanisms advanced to account for the specificity of the initiation of protein synthesis are reviewed. A mechanism proposed by Shine and Dalgarno (SD), focused on the base pairing of a unique leader sequence in the initiation site--the SD sequence--with the 3' end of the 30S ribosomal RNA as the only step necessary for selecting the initiation site in prokaryotes. Studies showed, however, that the SD interaction is not obligatory and protein synthesis can occur even in its absence. In fact, comparison of a large number of initiation site sequences revealed that the sites are composed of diverse combinations of preferred bases, and, thus, the apparatus that is able to recognize all these sites is de facto a multisubstrate enzyme system. As such, it has the hallmarks of the cumulative specificity mechanism, and the SD interaction, when present, is only one of a number of contributing factors in the selection of the initiation site. The cumulative specificity mechanism proposed that secondary structure selectively interdicts access to most of the non-initiator methionine codons while leaving open the true initiation site and that the final recognition of the initiation site occurs by cooperativity and cumulative specificity of the several ligand recognition sites of the ribosomes, which confer broad substrate specificity to the system. This mechanism appears to be universal; it can encompass the initiation of all protein syntheses since it is consistent with all the salient observations on the initiation of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic protein syntheses. Studies of eukaryotic/prokaryotic hybrid systems further strengthen this conclusion: They show that the prokaryotic initiation signals are evolutionarily conserved in the eukaryotic mRNAs, since prokaryotic ribosomes are able to translate eukaryotic mRNAs. Conversely, eukaryotic ribosomes also recognize prokaryotic initiation signals and initiate synthesis, indicating that the eukaryotic ribosomes may have also conserved the prokaryotic initiation mechanism. The universality of a single process of protein synthesis in all kingdoms is also manifest in the conservation of a complex apparatus, consisting of ribosomes, mRNA's, tRNA's including an initiator methionyl-tRNA, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, and other protein factors. Thus, the mechanism of initiation of protein synthesis is conserved, and it is universal. The third initiation mechanism is the scanning mechanism for eukaryotes. It proposes that the 40S ribosome-methionyl-tRNA complex recognizes and binds to the 5'-end of the mRNA and the complex then scans the messenger for the initiator codon. Once it is located, the 80S ribosome initiation complex is formed with the 60S subunit and initiation is completed when a second aminoacyl-tRNA is bound and a peptide bond is formed. Exceptions to this mechanism were observed, where the ribosome bound directly to internal mRNA sites and initiated synthesis. Consideration of the conflicting observations in this review, however, has led to the conclusion that the primary eukaryotic mechanism is a conserved prokaryotic mechanism and that the "scanning process" involves two steps. The first step is an interaction of the initiation factors with the cap, which makes the IS accessible, and the second, initiation of translation by the conserved prokaryotic mechanism.},

We applied SMURF to catalog putative clusters in 27 publicly available fungal genomes. Comparison with genetically characterized clusters from six fungal species showed that SMURF accurately recovered all clusters and detected additional potential clusters. Subsequent comparative analysis revealed the striking biosynthetic capacity and variability of the fungal SM pathways and the correlation between unicellularity and the absence of SMs. Further genetics studies are needed to experimentally confirm these clusters.},

The phenotypic malleability of this agent of human phaeohyphomycosis allows detailed study of its biology, virulence and the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the transitions among the morphotypes. Our prior studies have demonstrated the existence of seven chitin synthase structural genes in W. dermatitidis, each of which encodes an isoenzyme of a different class. Among them, the class V chitin synthase (WdChs5p) is most unique in terms of protein structure, because it has an N-terminal myosin motor-like domain with a P-loop (MMD) fused to its C-terminal chitin synthase catalytic domain (CSCD). However, the exact role played by WdChs5p in the different morphotypes remains undefined beyond the knowledge that it is the only single chitin synthase required for sustained cell growth at 37 degrees C and consequently virulence. This report describes the expression in Escherichia coli of a 12kDa polypeptide (WdMyo12p) of WdChs5p, which was used to raise in rabbits a polyclonal antibody that recognized exclusively its MMD region. Results from the use of the antibody in immunocytolocalization studies supported our previous findings that WdChs5p is critically important at infection temperatures for maintaining the cell wall integrity of developing yeast buds, elongating tips of hyphae, and random sites of expansion in sclerotic forms. The results also suggested that WdChs5p localizes to the regions of cell wall growth in an actin-dependent fashion.},

Sap9 and Sap10 are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored and located in the cell membrane or the cell wall. Both proteases are glycosylated, cleave at dibasic or basic processing sites similar to yapsins and Kex2-like proteases, and have functions in cell surface integrity and cell separation during budding. Overexpression of SAP9 in mutants lacking KEX2 or SAP10, or of SAP10 in mutants lacking KEX2 or SAP9, only partially restored these phenotypes, suggesting distinct target proteins of fungal origin for each of the three proteases. In addition, deletion of SAP9 and SAP10 modified the adhesion properties of C. albicans to epithelial cells and caused attenuated epithelial cell damage during experimental oral infection suggesting a unique role for these proteases in both cellular processes and host-pathogen interactions.},

abstract = {Candida albicans is the most common cause of hematogenously disseminated and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Both of these diseases are characterized by fungal invasion of host cells. Previously, we have found that C. albicans hyphae invade endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells in vitro by inducing their own endocytosis. Therefore, we set out to identify the fungal surface protein and host cell receptors that mediate this process. We found that the C. albicans Als3 is required for the organism to be endocytosed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells and two different human oral epithelial lines. Affinity purification experiments with wild-type and an als3delta/als3delta mutant strain of C. albicans demonstrated that Als3 was required for C. albicans to bind to multiple host cell surface proteins, including N-cadherin on endothelial cells and E-cadherin on oral epithelial cells. Furthermore, latex beads coated with the recombinant N-terminal portion of Als3 were endocytosed by Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human N-cadherin or E-cadherin, whereas control beads coated with bovine serum albumin were not. Molecular modeling of the interactions of the N-terminal region of Als3 with the ectodomains of N-cadherin and E-cadherin indicated that the binding parameters of Als3 to either cadherin are similar to those of cadherin-cadherin binding. Therefore, Als3 is a fungal invasin that mimics host cell cadherins and induces endocytosis by binding to N-cadherin on endothelial cells and E-cadherin on oral epithelial cells. These results uncover the first known fungal invasin and provide evidence that C. albicans Als3 is a molecular mimic of human cadherins.},

abstract = {Secreted aspartic proteinases (Saps) are important virulence factors during Candida albicans mucosal or disseminated infections. A differential expression of individual SAP genes has been shown previously in a model of oral candidosis based on reconstituted human epithelium (RHE), and in the oral cavity of patients. In this study, the ultrastructural localization of distinct groups of Sap isoenzymes expressed during RHE infection was shown by immunoelectron microscopy using specific polyclonal antibodies directed against the gene products of SAP1-3 and SAP4-6. Large amounts of Sap1-3 antigen were found within C. albicans yeast and hyphal cell walls, often predominantly in close contact with epithelial cells, whereas lower quantities of Sap4-6 were detected in hyphal cells. To elucidate the relevance of the expressed Saps during oral infections, we examined the effect of the aspartic proteinase inhibitor, pepstatin A, during infection of the RHE. The extent of lesions caused by the strain SC5314 was found to be strongly reduced by the inhibitor, indicating that proteinase activity contributes to tissue damage in this model. To clarify which of the SAP genes are important for tissue necrosis, the histology of RHE infection with Deltasap1, Deltasap2, Deltasap3, Deltasap4-6 and three Deltasap1/3 double mutants were examined. Although tissue damage was not blocked completely with these mutants, an attenuated phenotype was observed for each of the single sap null mutants, and was more strongly attenuated in the Deltasap1/3 double null mutants. In contrast, the lesions caused by the Deltasap4-6 triple mutant were at least as severe as those caused by SC5314. During infection with the mutants, we observed that the SAP gene expression pattern of the Deltasap1 and the Deltasap1/3 mutants was altered in comparison with the wild-type strain. Expression of SAP5 was observed only during infection with the Deltasap1/3 mutant, whereas upregulation of SAP2 and SAP8 transcripts was observed in the Deltasap1 and the Deltasap1/3 mutants. These results suggest that Sap1-3, but not Sap4-6, contribute to tissue damage in this model. Furthermore, C. albicans may compensate for the deletion of certain SAP genes by upregulation of alternative SAP genes.},

abstract = {Nitrogen uptake and metabolism are essential to microbial growth. Gat1 belongs to a conserved family of zinc finger containing transcriptional regulators known as GATA-factors. These factors activate the transcription of Nitrogen Catabolite Repression (NCR) sensitive genes when preferred nitrogen sources are absent or limiting. Cryptococcus neoformans GAT1 is an ortholog to the Aspergillus nidulans AreA and Candida albicans GAT1 genes. In an attempt to define the function of this transcriptional regulator in C. neoformans, we generated null mutants (gat1{\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashDelta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}) of this gene. The gat1 mutant exhibited impaired growth on all amino acids tested as sole nitrogen sources, with the exception of arginine and proline. Furthermore, the gat1 mutant did not display resistance to rapamycin, an immunosuppressant drug that transiently mimics a low-quality nitrogen source. Gat1 is not required for C. neoformans survival during macrophage infection or for virulence in a mouse model of cryptococcosis. Microarray analysis allowed the identification of target genes that are regulated by Gat1 in the presence of proline, a poor and non-repressing nitrogen source. Genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, iron uptake, cell wall organization and capsule biosynthesis, in addition to NCR-sensitive genes, are Gat1-regulated in C. neoformans.},

abstract = {Aspergillus flavus is a common saprophyte and opportunistic pathogen producing aflatoxin (AF) and many other secondary metabolites. 5-Azacytidine (5-AC), a derivative of the nucleoside cytidine, is widely used for studies in epigenetics and cancer biology as an inactivator of DNA methyltransferase and is also used for studying secondary metabolism in fungi. Our previous studies showed that 5-AC affects development and inhibits AF production in A. flavus, and that A. flavus lacks DNA methylation. In this study, an RNA-Seq approach was applied to explore the mechanism of 5-AC's effect on A. flavus. We identified 240 significantly differentially expressed (. Q-value. {\textless}. 0.05) genes after 5-AC treatment, including two backbone genes respectively in secondary metabolite clusters {\#}27 and {\#}35. These two clusters are involved in development or survival of sclerotia. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that these significantly differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in catalytic activity and proteolytic functions. The expressed transcripts of most genes in the AF biosynthetic gene cluster in A. flavus showed no significant changes after treatment with 5-AC and were expressed at low levels, and the transcription regulator genes aflR and aflS in this cluster did not show differential expression relative to the sample without 5-AC treatment. We found that the veA gene, which encodes protein bridges VelB and LaeA, decreased profoundly the expressed transcripts, and brlA, which encodes an early regulator of development, increased its transcripts in A. flavus after 5-AC treatment. Our data support a model whereby 5-AC affects development through increasing the expression of brlA by depressing the expression of veA and AF production through suppressing veA expression and dysregulating carboxypeptidase activity, which then prevents the aflatoxisomes (vesicles) from performing their normal function in AF formation. Furthermore, the suppressed veA expression weakens or even interrupts the connection between VelB and LaeA, leading to dysregulation of the expression pattern of genes involved in development and secondary metabolism in A. flavus. The RNA-seq data presented in this work were also served to improve the annotation of the A. flavus genome. This work provides a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of A. flavus responsive to 5-AC and supports the conclusion that fungal development and secondary metabolism are co-regulated. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We used culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. 28 fungal species belonging to 16 genera were isolated with selected culturing conditions, targeting human opportunistic yeasts and yeast-like fungi. Of special concern was the detection of Aureobasidium melanogenum, Exophiala dermatitidis, Rhinocladiella similis, Candida parapsilosis and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. The DGGE analysis of ITS1 rDNA revealed from 6 to 16 bands hypothetically corresponding to different taxa, while pyrosequencing showed the presence of Aspergillus and Exophiala. According to the statistic machine learning methodology, the profile of fungi in water is determined by the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions and the presence of nitrate. Exophiala spp., C. parapsilosis and R. mucilaginosa are known as dominant contaminants of household appliances. It appears that they are transferred with water to dishwashers and washing machines, where they subsequently proliferate.},

abstract = {Cladophialophora is a genus of asexual black yeast-like fungi with one-celled, hydrophobic conidia which is predicted to have teleomorphs in the ascomycete genus Capronia, a member of the order Chaetothyriales. Cladophialophora species are relatively frequently involved in human disease ranging from mild cutaneous lesions to cerebral abscesses. Although the natural niche outside humans is unknown for most opportunistic Cladophialophora species, the fungi concerned are rarely isolated from environmental samples such as dead plant material, rotten wood, or soil. The objective of the present paper is to describe a novel species of Cladophialophora which was isolated from soil polluted with benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX). It proved to be able to grow with toluene and other related alkylbenzenes as its sole carbon and energy source. This strain is of interest for the biodegradation of toluene and other related xenobiotics under growth limiting conditions, particularly in air biofilters, dry and/or acidic soil. A preliminary genetic analysis using multilocus sequencing typing (MLST) and amplified fragments length polymorphism (AFLP) showed that this fungus was closely related to the pathogenic species Cladophialophora bantiana, sharing a C. bantiana-specific intron in SSU rDNA. However, it was unable to grow at 40°C and proved to be non-virulent in mice. The clear phylogenetic and ecophysiological delimitation of the species is fundamental to prevent biohazard in engineered bioremediation applications.},

We focused on the isolation of fungi from two user-accessible parts of washing machines that often contain microbial biofilms: drawers for detergents and rubber door seals. Out of 70 residential washing machines sampled in Slovenia, 79{\%} were positive for fungi. In total, 72 strains belonging to 12 genera and 26 species were isolated. Among these, members of the Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani species complexes, Candida parapsilosis and Exophiala phaeomuriformis represented 44{\%} of fungi detected. These species are known as opportunistic human pathogens and can cause skin, nail or eye infections also in healthy humans. A machine learning analysis revealed that presence of detergents and softeners followed by washing temperature, represent most critical factors for fungal colonization. Three washing machines with persisting malodour that resulted in bad smelling laundry were analysed for the presence of fungi and bacteria. In these cases, fungi were isolated in low numbers (7.5?{\%}), while bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Sphingomonas species prevailed.},

They are able to cope with different stressors determined by the typical conditions of bare rocks in hot and cold extreme environments. In this study first results of a system biological approach based on two-dimensional protein profiles are presented. Protein patterns of extremotolerant black fungi -Coniosporium perforans, Exophiala jeanselmei - and of the extremophilic fungus -Friedmanniomyces endolithicus - were compared with the cosmopolitan and mesophilic hyphomycete Penicillium chrysogenum in order to follow and determine changes in the expression pattern under different temperatures. The 2D protein gels indicated a temperature dependent qualitative change in all the tested strains. Whereas the reference strain P. chrysogenum expressed the highest number of proteins at 40 °C, thus exhibiting real signs of temperature induced reaction, black fungi, when exposed to temperatures far above their growth optimum, decreased the number of proteins indicating a down-regulation of their metabolism. Temperature of 1 °C led to an increased number of proteins in all of the analysed strains, with the exception of P. chrysogenum. These first results on temperature dependent reactions in rock inhabiting black fungi indicate a rather different strategy to cope with non-optimal temperature than in the mesophilic hyphomycete P. chrysogenum.},

Species belonging to genera Aspergillus, Candida, Magnusiomyces, Fusarium, Penicillium and Rhodotorula were found occasionally, while the black yeasts Exophiala dermatitidis and Exophiala phaeomuriformis (Chaetothyriales) were persistently and most frequently isolated. Sixty-two percent of the dishwashers were positive for fungi, and 56{\%} of these accommodated Exophiala. Both Exophiala species are known to be able to cause systemic disease in humans and frequently colonize the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. We conclude that high temperature, high moisture and alkaline pH values typically occurring in dishwashers can provide an alternative habitat for species also known to be pathogenic to humans.},

abstract = {Specific indoor environments select for certain stress-tolerant fungi and can drive their evolution towards acquiring medically important traits. Here we review the current knowledge in this area of research, focussing on the so-called black yeasts. Many of these melanised stress-tolerant organisms originate in unusual ecological niches in nature, and they have a number of preadaptations that make them particularly suited for growth on human-made surfaces and substrates. Several pathogenic species have been isolated recently from various domestic habitats. We argue that in addition to enriching for - potentially - pathogenic species, the selection pressure and stress acting on microorganisms in indoor environments are driving their evolution towards acquiring the missing virulence factors and further enhancing their stress tolerance and pathogenic potential. Some of the polyextremotolerant fungi are particularly problematic: they can grow at elevated temperatures, and so they have a higher potential to colonise warm-blooded organisms. As several species of black fungi are already implicated in health problems of various kinds, their selection and possible evolution in human environments are of concern.},

abstract = {Black meristematic fungi can survive high doses of radiation and are resistant to desiccation. These adaptations help them to colonize harsh oligotrophic habitats, e.g., on the surface and subsurface of rocks. One of their most characteristic stress-resistance mechanisms is the accumulation of melanin in the cell walls. This, production of other protective molecules and a plastic morphology further contribute to ecological flexibility of black fungi. Increased growth rates of some species after exposure to ionizing radiation even suggest yet unknown mechanisms of energy production. Other unusual metabolic strategies may include harvesting UV or visible light or gaining energy by forming facultative lichen-like associations with algae or cyanobacteria. The latter is not entirely surprising, since certain black fungal lineages are phylogenetically related to clades of lichen-forming fungi. Similar to black fungi, lichen-forming fungi are adapted to growth on exposed surfaces with low availability of nutrients. They also efficiently use protective molecules to tolerate frequent periods of extreme stress. Traits shared by both groups of fungi may have been important in facilitating the evolution and radiation of lichen-symbioses.},

abstract = {Iron is an essential but, in excess, toxic nutrient. Therefore, fungi evolved fine-tuned mechanisms for uptake and storage of iron, such as the production of siderophores (low-molecular mass iron-specific chelators). In Aspergillus fumigatus, iron starvation causes extensive transcriptional remodeling involving two central transcription factors, which are interconnected in a negative transcriptional feed-back loop: the GATA-factor SreA and the bZip-factor HapX. During iron sufficiency, SreA represses iron uptake, including reductive iron assimilation and siderophore-mediated iron uptake, to avoid toxic effects. During iron starvation, HapX represses iron-consuming pathways, including heme biosynthesis and respiration, to spare iron and activates synthesis of ribotoxin AspF1 and siderophores, the latter partly by ensuring supply of the precursor, ornithine. In accordance with the expression pattern and mode of action, detrimental effects of inactivation of SreA and HapX are confined to growth during iron sufficiency and iron starvation, respectively. Deficiency in HapX, but not SreA, attenuates virulence of A. fumigatus in a murine model of aspergillosis, which underlines the crucial role of adaptation to iron limitation in virulence. Consistently, production of both extra and intracellular siderophores is crucial for virulence of A. fumigatus. Recently, the sterol regulatory element binding protein SrbA was found to be essential for adaptation to iron starvation, thereby linking regulation of iron metabolism, ergosterol biosynthesis, azole drug resistance, and hypoxia adaptation.},

We have quantified C. albicans and M. musculus gene expression dynamics during phagocytosis by dendritic cells in a genome-wide, time-resolved analysis using simultaneous RNA-seq. A robust network inference map was generated from this dataset using NetGenerator, predicting novel interactions between the host and the pathogen. We experimentally verified predicted interdependent sub-networks comprising Hap3 in C. albicans, and Ptx3 and Mta2 in M. musculus. Remarkably, binding of recombinant Ptx3 to the C. albicans cell wall was found to regulate the expression of fungal Hap3 target genes as predicted by the network inference model. Pre-incubation of C. albicans with recombinant Ptx3 significantly altered the expression of Mta2 target cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-4 in a Hap3-dependent manner, further suggesting a role for Mta2 in host-pathogen interplay as predicted in the network inference model. We propose an integrated model for the functionality of these sub-networks during fungal invasion of immune cells, according to which binding of Ptx3 to the C. albicans cell wall induces remodeling via fungal Hap3 target genes, thereby altering the immune response to the pathogen. We show the applicability of network inference to predict interactions between host-pathogen pairs, demonstrating the usefulness of this systems biology approach to decipher mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Bacteria adapt to ever-changing habitats through specific responses to internal and external stimuli that result in changes in gene regulation and metabolism. One internal metabolic cue affecting such changes in Escherichia coli and related enteric species is cytoplasmic accumulation of phosphorylated sugars such as glucose-6-phosphate or the non-metabolizable analog {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}-methylglucoside-6-phosphate. This "glucose-phosphate stress" triggers a dedicated stress response in {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashgamma{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}-proteobacteria including several enteric pathogens. The major effector of this stress response is a small RNA (sRNA), SgrS. In E. coli and Salmonella, SgrS regulates numerous mRNA targets via base pairing interactions that result in alterations in mRNA translation and stability. Regulation of target mRNAs allows cells to reduce import of additional sugars and increase sugar efflux. SgrS is an unusual sRNA in that it also encodes a small protein, SgrT, which inhibits activity of the major glucose transporter. The two functions of SgrS, base pairing and production of SgrT, reduce accumulation of phosphorylated sugars and thereby relieve stress and promote growth. Examination of SgrS homologs in many enteric species suggests that SgrS has evolved to regulate distinct targets in different organisms. For example, in Salmonella, SgrS base pairs with sopD mRNA and represses production of the encoded effector protein, suggesting that SgrS may have a specific role in the pathogenesis of some {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashgamma{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}-proteobacteria. In this review, we outline molecular mechanisms involved in SgrS regulation of its target mRNAs. We also discuss the response to glucose-phosphate stress in terms of its impact on metabolism, growth physiology, and pathogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex that associates with ribosomes to promote co-translational translocation of proteins across biological membranes. We have used comparative analysis of a large number of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic SRP RNA sequences to derive shared tertiary SRP RNA structure elements. RESULTS: A representative three-dimensional model of the human SRP RNA is shown that includes single-stranded intrahelical and interhelical RNA loops and incorporates data from enzymatic and chemical modification, electron microscopy, and site-directed mutagenesis. Properties of the SRP RNA model are an overall extended dumbbell-shaped structure (260 A x 70 A) with a pseudoknot in the small SRP domain (a pairing of 12-UGGC-15 with 33-GCUA-36), and a tertiary interaction in the large SRP domain (198-GA-199 with 232-GU-233). CONCLUSIONS: The RNA 'knuckle' formed in helix 8 of SRP RNA appears to constitute the binding site for protein SRP54 or its bacterial equivalent, protein P48. A dynamic property of this feature may explain the hierarchial assembly of proteins SRP19 and SRP54 in the large SRP domain. Furthermore, the human SRP RNA model serves as a framework to understand details of the structure and function of SRP in all organisms and is presented to stimulate further experimentation in this area.},

Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating {\~{}}356,660 candidate SNPs in {\~{}}117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of {\~{}}1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w(1118); iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that {\~{}}15,842 SNPs are synonymous and {\~{}}4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S {\~{}}0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3' UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory.},

In this context C. albicans is able to adhere to a plethora of different cell types providing different microenvironments for colonization. To study the response of C. albicans adhering to different surfaces on the transcriptional level we have established an in vitro adhesion assay exploiting confluent monolayers of the human colorectal carcinoma cell line Caco-2 or epidermoid vulvo-vaginal A-431 cells. Candida albicans very efficiently adheres to these epithelia growing as hyphae. Using whole-genome DNA microarrays comprising probes for almost 7000 predicted ORFs we found that transcriptional profiles of C. albicans adhering to Caco-2 or to A-431 cells, although very similar, still significantly differ from those of Candida cells adhering to plastic surfaces. Differences became even more obvious when comparing C. albicans cells either growing in an adherent manner or in suspension culture. Correspondingly, we found for several cell surface genes, including PRA1, PGA23, PGA7 and HWP1, an adhesion-dependent induction of transcription. Obviously, C. albicans is able to respond specifically to very subtle differences in the environment during adhesion to various growth substrates.},

abstract = {The response of yeast cells to sudden temperature downshifts has received little attention compared with other stress conditions. Like other organisms, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a decrease in temperature induces the expression of many genes involved in transcription and translation, some of which display a cold-sensitivity phenotype. However, little is known about the role played by many cold-responsive genes, the sensing and regulatory mechanisms that control this response or the biochemical adaptations at or near 0 degrees C. This review focuses on the physiological significance of cold-shock responses, emphasizing the molecular mechanisms that generate and transmit cold signals. There is now enough experimental evidence to conclude that exposure to low temperature protects yeast cells against freeze injury through the cold-induced accumulation of trehalose, glycerol and heat-shock proteins. Recent results also show that changes in membrane fluidity are the primary signal triggering the cold-shock response. Notably, this signal is transduced and regulated through classical stress pathways and transcriptional factors, the high-osmolarity glycerol mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and Msn2/4p. Alternative cold-stress generators and transducers will also be presented and discussed.},

Partly due to lack of clues from primary sequences, insight into the biochemical functions or molecular targets of these proteins has been slow to emerge. However, for some proteins important progress has recently been made in this direction.

In the present study we elucidate the role of U. maydis small HSPs in the pathogenicity as well as general stress response of the fungus. Through quantitative real time PCR analysis the expression levels of small HSP genes in comparison with other HSPs were assessed both during infection of the host plant Zea mays and when the pathogen was subjected to an abiotic stress such as oxidative stress. This study revealed that contrary to other HSPs, small HSPs showed an increased level of differential expression under both the tested conditions, indicating a possible role of small HSPs in the pathogenicity and stress response of U. maydis. This has been further confirmed by generation of deletion and complementation strains of three putative small HSPs.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) orchestrate gene expression control of a cell and, in many respects, their repertoire determines the life and functionality of the cell. For a better understanding of their regulatory mechanisms, it is essential to know the entire repertoire of TFs of a species. The increasing number of sequenced genomes together with the development of computational methods allow us not only to predict whole sets of TFs but also to analyse and compare them. Such an analysis is required in particular for fungal species, as our knowledge of the potential set of TFs in fungi is very limited. In fact, at present we do not know which TFs can in general be found in fungi, and which of them are strictly fungal specific. Other interesting questions regard the evolutionary relationships of fungal TFs with other kingdoms and the functions of fungal-specific TFs. This minireview addresses these issues. The analysis of predicted occurrences of DNA-binding domains in 62 fungal genomes reveals a set of 37 potential 'fungal' TF families. Six families are fungal-specific, i.e. they do not appear in other kingdoms. Interestingly, the fungal-specific TFs are not restricted to strictly fungal-specific functions. Consideration of fungal TF distributions in different kingdoms provides a platform to discuss the evolution of domains and TFs.},

Biofilters were operated in parallel for 185 days in which the volumetric organic loading rate was progressively increased. The operation regime was subjected to drying out, so that packing humidity generally remained below 40{\%}. Significant process failure occurred with ethylbenzene and p-xylene, but the toluene biofilter comparatively sustained a significant elimination capacity. Microbial community characterization by quantitative PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed substantial fungal enrichment in the toluene biofilter. Ribotypes identical to the well-known toluene-degrading black yeast Exophiala oligosperma (Chaetotyriales) were found among the dominant species. The microbial community structure was similar in the biofilters loaded with toluene and ethylbenzene but with p-xylene was quite specific and encompassed other chaetothyrialean fungi. Several species of Actinomycetales were found in the packing while the inoculum was dominated by representatives of the Burkholderiales and Xanthomonadales. One single fungal ribotype homologous to Acremonium kiliense was detected in the inoculum. The implications of xerophilic biofilter operation on process biosafety and efficiency are discussed.},

abstract = {Lichen-forming fungi are among the most diverse group of organisms in Antarctica. Being poikilohydric, lichens are able to cope with harsh environmental conditions that exclude other organisms like vascular plants. The McMurdo Dry Valleys (Victoria Land, Continental Antarctica) are a hyperarid cold desert where macroscopic life is reduced to a few lichens and bryophyte species. We investigated the diversity of lichen-forming fungi and their associated photobionts in three valleys (Garwood, Marshall, and Miers). Correct identification of lichen-forming fungi from extreme ecosystems is complicated by the presence of numerous sterile and extremely modified thalli. To overcome this problem, we used a combined approach for the identification of the species present in the area, the first involving identification by means of standard characters and the second, two DNA-based (ITS region) species delimitation methods (General Mixed Yule-Coalescent model and genetic distances). In addition, we also used ITS sequences for the identification of the photobionts associated with the mycobionts. We studied the relationships between both bionts and assessed the degree of selectivity and specificity found in those associations. We also looked for landscape level spatial patterns in these associations. The two DNA-based methods performed quite differently, but 27 species of lichen-forming fungi and five putative species of photobionts were found in the studied area. Although there was a general trend for low selectivity in the relationships, high specificity was found in some associations and differential selectivity was observed in some lichen-forming fungi. No spatial structure was detected in the distribution of photobionts in the studied area.},

abstract = {Cryptococcal phospholipase (PLB1) is a secreted enzyme with lysophospholipase hydrolase and lysophospholipase transacylase activities. To investigate the role of PLB1 in the evasion of host immune responses, we characterized pulmonary immune responses to the parental (H99), the plb1 mutant, and the plb1(rec) reconstituted mutant strains of Cryptococcus neoformans in mice. PLB1 was required for virulence during infection acquired via the respiratory tract. Mice infected with either H99 or the plb1(rec) strain generated a nonprotective inflammatory response with subsequent eosinophilia, while mice infected with the plb1 mutant generated a protective immune response that controlled the infection. Because PLB1 is believed to facilitate virulence through host cell lysis, we examined the interaction of these strains with macrophages. The plb1(rec) mutant exhibited decreased survival during coculture with macrophages. One factor which may be involved in the survival of yeast in the presence of macrophages is fungal eicosanoid production. Host eicosanoids have been shown to down-modulate macrophage functions. plb1 exhibited a defect in eicosanoid production derived from exogenous arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine, suggesting that PLB1 is required for the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids. These data suggest that cryptococcal PLB1 may act as a virulence factor by enhancing the ability to survive macrophage antifungal defenses, possibly by facilitating fungal eicosanoid production.},

He was treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and then received a second-course radiotherapy with IMRT. 18S rDNA sequencing revealed that the isolates belong to Exophiala dermatitidis which was susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole. Interestingly, E. dermatitidis isolates were resistant to caspofungin and one isolate was resistant to amphotericin B. Both isolates formed biofilms comparable to that of Candida albicans. Single isolate of E. dermatitidis showed hemolysin and proteinase ability comparable to C. albicans whilst the other isolate was not.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We, for the first time, reported the discovery of a black fungus-E. dermatitidis isolates derived from a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy. These isolates were shown to be resistant to caspofungin, a major antifungal agent for systemic candidiasis. As little is known about the black fungus in the clinical setting, it is important that clinicians must keep abreast of the new discovery in this field.},

abstract = {The fungal cell wall plays a crucial role in host-pathogen interactions. Its formation is the result of the coordinated activity of several extracellular enzymes, which assemble the constituents, and remodel and hydrolyse them in the extracellular space. Candida albicans Phr1 and Phr2 proteins belong to family GH72 of the beta-(1,3)-glucanosyltransferases and play a crucial role in cell wall assembly. PHR1 and PHR2, homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAS1, are differently regulated by extracellular pH. PHR1 is expressed when ambient pH is 5.5 or higher, whereas PHR2 has the reverse expression pattern. Their deletion causes a pH-conditional defect in morphogenesis and virulence. In this work we explored whether PHR1 deletion affects the ability of C. albicans to adhere to and invade human epithelia. PHR1 null mutants exhibited a marked reduction in adhesion to both abiotic surfaces and epithelial cell monolayers. In addition, the mutant was unable to penetrate and invade reconstituted human epithelia. Transcription profiling of selected hyphal-specific and adhesin-encoding genes indicated that in the PHR1 null mutant, HWP1 and ECE1 transcript levels were similarly reduced in both adhesion and suspension conditions. These results, combined with microscopy analysis of the septum position, suggest that PHR1 is not required for the induction of hyphal development but plays a key role in the maintenance of hyphal growth. Thus, the beta-(1,3)-glucan processing catalysed by Phr1p is of fundamental importance in the maintenance of the morphological state on which the adhesive and invasive properties of C. albicans greatly depend.},

The concomitant presence of viable bacteria and filamentous fungi has also been observed. In all, 257 yeast strains were isolated and identified by 26S rRNA gene D1/D2 and internal transcribed spacers (1 and 2) sequencing as belonging to 28 ascomycetous and basidiomycetous species of 11 genera (Candida, Cystofilobasidium, Cryptococcus, Dioszegia, Erythrobasidium, Guehomyces, Mastigobasidium, Mrakia, Mrakiella, Rhodotorula and Sporobolomyces). Among them, the species Cryptococcus gastricus accounted for almost 40{\%} of the total isolates. In addition, 12 strains were identified as belonging to the yeast-like species Aureobasidium pullulans and Exophiala dermatitidis, whereas 15 strains, presumably belonging to new species, yet to be described, were also isolated. Results herein reported indicate that the Calderone Glacier, although currently considered a vanishing ice body due to the ongoing global-warming phenomenon, still harbors viable psychrophilic yeast populations.

abstract = {Protein synthesis is regulated in response to environmental stimuli
by covalent modification, primarily phosphorylation, of components
of the translational machinery. Phosphorylation of the alpha subunit
of eIF-2 is one of the best-characterized mechanisms for down-regulating
protein synthesis in higher eukaryotes in response to various stress
conditions. Three distinct protein kinases regulate protein synthesis
in eukaryotic cells by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of eIF-2
at serine-51. There are two mammalian eIF-2alpha kinases: the double-stranded
RNA-dependent kinase (PKR) and heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI),
and the yeast GCN2. The regulatory mechanisms and the molecular sizes
of these eIF-2alpha kinases are different. The expression of PKR
is induced by interferon, and the kinase activity is stimulated by
low concentrations of double-stranded RNA. HRI is activated under
heme-deficient conditions. Yeast GCN2 is activated by amino acid
starvation. The phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha results in the shutdown
of protein synthesis. Nevertheless, the eIF-2alpha kinases can regulate
both global as well as specific mRNA translation. Inhibition of protein
synthesis correlates with eIF-2alpha phosphorylation in response
to a wide variety of different stimuli, including heat shock, serum

abstract = {Antisense agents are valuable tools to inhibit the expression of
a target gene in a sequence-specific manner, and may be used for
functional genomics, target validation and therapeutic purposes.
Three types of anti-mRNA strategies can be distinguished. Firstly,
the use of single stranded antisense-oligonucleotides; secondly,
the triggering of RNA cleavage through catalytically active oligonucleotides
referred to as ribozymes; and thirdly, RNA interference induced by
small interfering RNA molecules. Despite the seemingly simple idea
to reduce translation by oligonucleotides complementary to an mRNA,
several problems have to be overcome for successful application.
Accessible sites of the target RNA for oligonucleotide binding have
to be identified, antisense agents have to be protected against nucleolytic
attack, and their cellular uptake and correct intracellular localization
have to be achieved. Major disadvantages of commonly used phosphorothioate
DNA oligonucleotides are their low affinity towards target RNA molecules
and their toxic side-effects. Some of these problems have been solved
in 'second generation' nucleotides with alkyl modifications at the
2' position of the ribose. In recent years valuable progress has
been achieved through the development of novel chemically modified
nucleotides with improved properties such as enhanced serum stability,
higher target affinity and low toxicity. In addition, RNA-cleaving
ribozymes and deoxyribozymes, and the use of 21-mer double-stranded
RNA molecules for RNA interference applications in mammalian cells
offer highly efficient strategies to suppress the expression of a
specific gene.},

The RNAi machinery consists of three core components: Dicer, Argonaute, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In fungi, the RNAi-related pathways have three major functions: genomic defense, heterochromatin formation, and gene regulation. Studies of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Neurospora, and other fungi have uncovered surprisingly diverse small RNA biogenesis pathways, suggesting that fungi utilize RNAi-related pathways in various cellular processes to adapt to different environmental conditions. These studies also provided important insights into how RNAi functions in eukaryotic systems in general. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of the fungal RNAi-related pathways and their functions, with a focus on filamentous fungi. We will also discuss how RNAi can be used as a tool in fungal research.},

Northern blotting showed that WdCHS5 is expressed at high levels under conditions of stress. Analysis of the 5' upstream region of WdCHS5 fused to a reporter gene indicated that one or more of the potential regulatory elements present may have contributed to the high expression levels. Disruption of WdCHS5 produced mutants that grow normally at 25degreesC but have severe growth and cellular abnormalities at 37degreesC. Osmotic stabilizers, such as sorbitol and sucrose, rescued the wild-type phenotype, which indicated that the loss of WdChs5p causes cell wall integrity defects. Animal survival tests with a mouse model of acute infection showed that all wdchs5Delta mutants are less virulent than the parental strain. Reintroduction of the WdCHS5 gene into the wdchs5Delta mutants abolished the temperature-sensitive phenotype and reestablished their virulence. We conclude that the product of WdCHS5 is required for the sustained growth of W. dermatitidis at 37degreesC and is of critical importance to its virulence.},

abstract = {APSES transcription factors are well-known regulators of fungal cellular development and differentiation. To study the function of an APSES protein in the fungus Wangiella dermatitidis, a conidiogenous and polymorphic agent of human phaeohyphomycosis with yeast predominance, the APSES transcription factor gene WdSTUA was cloned, sequenced, disrupted, and overexpressed. Analysis showed that its derived protein was most similar to the APSES proteins of other conidiogenous molds and had its APSES DNA-binding domain located in the amino-terminal half. Deletion of WdSTUA in W. dermatitidis induced convoluted instead of normal smooth colony surface growth on the rich yeast maintenance agar medium yeast extract-peptone-dextrose agar (YPDA) at 37 degrees C. Additionally, deletion of WdSTUA repressed aerial hyphal growth, conidiation, and invasive hyphal growth on the nitrogen-poor, hypha-inducing agar medium potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25 degrees C. Ectopic overexpression of WdSTUA repressed the convoluted colony surface growth on YPDA at 37 degrees C, and also strongly repressed hyphal growth on PDA at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C. These new results provide additional insights into the diverse roles played by APSES factors in fungi. They also suggest that the transcription factor encoded by WdSTUA is both a positive and negative morphotype regulator in W. dermatitidis and possibly other of the numerous human pathogenic, conidiogenous fungi capable of yeast growth.},

abstract = {Pinus taeda wood chips were treated with the biopulping fungus, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, under solid-state fermentation for periods varying from 7 to 90 days. Low molecular mass compounds and oxidative enzymes were extracted from biotreated wood samples. Manganese-dependent peroxidase was the main oxidative enzyme on all biodegradation periods. Aqueous extracts from biotreated wood presented decreasing pH values, oxalic acid being the major organic acid secreted by the fungus. Analysis of these extracts by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) revealed small amounts of fatty acids, several short-chain organic acids (C3–C6) and numerous sugar derivatives. 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy benzaldehyde, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy benzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid and tricarboxy-benzene were also found in the wood extracts. A remarkable characteristic of the wood extracts was a strong Fe3+-reducing ability. High Fe3+-reducing activity and high catechol concentrations were detected in the wood extracts from the undecayed control. This reducing activity and catechol concentrations decreased during the first 7 days of biodegradation. However, from the seventh day of culturing, catechol derivatives coming from lignin degradation start to accumulate in the cultures and Fe3+-reduction activity increased again. The Fe3+-reduction activity observed in the wood extracts indicates that Fe2+ would be available in solution during the wood decay process. Considering that Fe2+ and H2O2 (produced by this fungus based on MnP-degradation of oxalate) were present in the wood extracts, at least some extent for degradation reactions based on Fenton-chemistry, similarly to the observed in brown-rot fungi, is supposed to occur during wood decay by C. subvermispora.},

MnP activity was not observed in Mn2+-free cultures of A. praecox. In Mn2+-supplemented cultures, S. coronilla produced at least two MnPs, of which the main isoform MnP1 has a pI of 6.3-7.1 and a MW of 41 kDa. In addition, S. coronilla possesses a partly constitutive MnP (MnP2) which was also detectable in Mn2+-free cultures, although its amount was considerably lower. MnP2 showed two distinct bands with acidic pIs of 3.5 and 3.7 in the IEF gel and has a MW of 41 kDa. There are indications for the existence of a third, likewise Mn2+-inducible enzyme (MnP3), that could not be separated from MnP2 but formed an additional band in eletrophoretic analyses (pI 5.1, MW 43 kDa). {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Halophiles are involved in centuries-old processes such as the manufacturing of solar salt from seawater and the production of traditional fermented foods. Two biotechnological processes involving halophiles are highly successful: the production of beta-carotene by the green alga Dunaliella and the production of ectoine (1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid), used as a stabilizer for enzymes and now also applied in cosmetic products, from moderately halophilic bacteria. The potential use of bacteriorhodopsin, the retinal protein proton pump of Halobacterium, in optoelectronic devices and photochemical processes is being explored, and may well lead to commercial applications in the near future. Demand for salt-tolerant enzymes in current manufacturing or related processes is limited. Other possible uses of halophilic microorganisms such as treatment of saline and hypersaline wastewaters, and the production of exopolysaccharides, poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoate bioplastics and biofuel are being investigated, but no large-scale applications have yet been reported.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: Once they have been generated, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and other persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can persist in soils and sediments and in waste repositories for periods extending from decades to centuries. In 1994, the US EPA concluded that contaminated sites and other reservoirs are likely to become the major source of contemporary pollution problems with these substances. With this in mind, this article is the first in a new series in ESPR under the title 'Case Studies on Dioxin and POP Contaminated Sites--Contemporary and Future Relevance and Challenges', which will address this important issue. The series will document various experiences from sites contaminated with PCDD/F and other POPs. This article provides an overview of the content of the articles comprising the series. In addition, it provides a review of the subject in its own right and identifies the key issues arising from dioxin/POP-contaminated sites. Additionally, it highlights the important conclusions that can be drawn from these examples. The key aim of this article and of the series as a whole is to provide a comprehensive overview of the types of PCDD/F contaminated sites that exist as a result of historical activities. It details the various processes whereby these sites became contaminated and attempts to evaluate their contemporary relevance as sources of PCDD/Fs and other POPs. It also details the various strategies used to assess these historical legacies of contamination and the concepts developed, or which are under development, to effect their remediation.

MAIN FEATURES: Special sessions on 'Contaminated sites--Cases, remediation, risk and policy' were held at the DIOXIN conferences in 2006 and 2007, and this theme will be continued at DIOXIN 2008 to be held in Birmingham. Selected cases from the approximately 70 contributions made to these sessions, together with some additional invited case studies are outlined together with the key issues they raise. By evaluating these cases and adding details of experiences published in the current literature, an overview will be given of the different features and challenges of dioxin and POP-contaminated sites.

RESULTS: This article provides a systematic categorisation of types of PCDD/F and POP-contaminated sites. These are categorised according to the chemical or manufacturing process, which generated the PCDD/Fs or POPs and also includes the use and disposal aspects of the product life cycle in question. The highest historical PCDD/F and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination burdens have arisen as a result of the production of chlorine and of chlorinated organic chemicals. In particular, the production of chlorinated pesticides, PCBs and the related contaminated waste streams are identified being responsible for historical releases of toxic equivalents (TEQs) at a scale of many tonnes. Along with such releases, major PCDD/F contaminated sites have been created through the application or improper disposal of contaminated pesticides, PCBs and other organochlorine chemicals, as well through the recycling of wastes and their attempted destruction. In some extreme examples, PCDD/F contaminated sites have also resulted from thermal processes such as waste incinerators, secondary metal industries or from the recycling or deposition of specific waste (e.g. electronic waste or car shredder wastes), which often contain chlorinated or brominated organic chemicals. The examples of PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB contamination of fish in European rivers or the impact of contaminated sites upon fishing grounds and upon other food resources demonstrate the relevance of these historical problems to current and future human generations. Many of the recent food contamination problems that have emerged in Europe and elsewhere demonstrate how PCDD/F and dioxin like PCBs from historical sources can directly contaminate human and animal feedstuffs and indeed highlight their considerable contemporary relevance in this respect. Accordingly, some key experiences and lessons learnt regarding the production, use, disposal and remediation of POPs from the contaminated sites are summarised.

DISCUSSION: An important criterion for evaluating the significance and risks of PCDD/Fs and other POPs at contaminated sites is their present or future potential for mobility. This, in turn, determines to a large degree their propensity for off-site transport and environmental accessibility. The detailed evaluation of contaminated site cases reveals different site-specific factors, which influence the varied pathways through which poor water-soluble POPs can be mobilised. Co-contaminants with greater water solubility are also typically present at such sites. Hence, pumping of groundwater (pump and treat) is often required in addition to attempting to physically secure a site. At an increasing number of contaminated sites, securing measures are failing after relatively short time spans compared to the time horizon, which applies to persistent organic pollutant contamination. Due to the immense costs and challenges associated with remediation of contaminated sites 'monitored natural attenuation' is increasingly gaining purchase as a conceptual remediation approach. However, these concepts may well prove limited in their practical application to contaminated sites containing persistent organic pollutants and other key pollutants like heavy metals.

CONCLUSIONS: It is inevitable, therefore, that dioxin/POP-contaminated sites will remain of contemporary and future relevance. They will continue to represent an environmental issue for future generations to address. The securing and/or remediation of dioxin/POP-contaminated sites is very costly, generally in the order of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Secured landfills and secured production sites need to be considered as constructions not made for 'eternity' but built for a finite time scale. Accordingly, they will need to be controlled, supervised and potentially repaired/renewed. Furthermore, the leachates and groundwater impacted by these sites will require ongoing monitoring and potential further remediation. These activities result in high maintenance costs, which are accrued for decades or centuries and should, therefore, be compared to the fully sustainable option of complete remediation. The contaminated site case studies highlight that, while extensive policies and established funds for remediation exist in most of the industrialised western countries, even these relatively well-regulated and wealthy countries face significant challenges in the implementation of a remediation strategy. This highlights the fact that ultimately only the prevention of contaminated sites represents a sustainable solution for the future and that the Polluter Pays Principle needs to be applied in a comprehensive way to current problems and those which may emerge in the future.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: With the continuing shift of industrial activities in developing and transition economies, which often have poor regulation (and weak self-regulation of industries), additional global challenges regarding POPs and other contaminated sites may be expected. In this respect, a comprehensive application of the "polluter pays principle" in these countries will also be a key to facilitate the clean-up of contaminated areas and the prevention of future contaminated sites. The threats and challenges of contaminated sites and the high costs of securing/remediating the problems highlight the need for a comprehensive approach based upon integrated pollution prevention and control. If applied to all polluting (and potentially polluting) industrial sectors around the globe, such an approach will prove to be both the cheapest and most sustainable way to underpin the development of industries in developing and transition economies.},

abstract = {Interest in the biodegradation mechanisms and environmental fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is motivated by their ubiquitous distribution, their low bioavailability and high persistence in soil, and their potentially deleterious effect on human health. Due to high hydrophobicity and solid-water distribution ratios, PAHs tend to interact with non-aqueous phases and soil organic matter and, as a consequence, become potentially unavailable for microbial degradation since bacteria are known to degrade chemicals only when they are dissolved in water. As the aqueous solubility of PAHs decreases almost logarithmically with increasing molecular mass, high-molecular weight PAHs ranging in size from five to seven rings are of special environmental concern. Whereas several reviews have focussed on metabolic and ecological aspects of PAH degradation, this review discusses the microbial PAH-degradation with special emphasis on both biological and physico-chemical factors influencing the biodegradation of poorly available PAHs.},

abstract = {Biofilms are interface micro-habitats formed by microbes that differ markedly from those of the ambient environment. The term 'subaerial biofilm' (SAB) was coined for microbial communities that develop on solid mineral surfaces exposed to the atmosphere. Subaerial biofilms are ubiquitous, self-sufficient, miniature microbial ecosystems that are found on buildings, bare rocks in deserts, mountains, and at all latitudes where direct contact with the atmosphere and solar radiation occurs. Subaerial biofilms on exposed terrestrial surfaces are characterized by patchy growth that is dominated by associations of fungi, algae, cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. Inherent subaerial settlers include specialized actinobacteria (e.g. Geodermatophilus), cyanobacteria and microcolonial fungi. Individuals within SAB communities avoid sexual reproduction, but cooperate extensively with one another especially to avoid loss of energy and nutrients. Subaerial biofilm metabolic activity centres on retention of water, protecting the cells from fluctuating environmental conditions and solar radiation as well as prolonging their vegetative life. Atmospheric aerosols, gases and propagatory particles serve as sources of nutrients and inoculum for these open communities. Subaerial biofilms induce chemical and physical changes to rock materials, and they penetrate the mineral substrate contributing to rock and mineral decay, which manifests itself as bio-weathering of rock surfaces. Given their characteristic slow and sensitive growth, SAB may also serve as bioindicators of atmospheric and/or climate change.},

examined in Drosophila melanogaster embryo lysate for their requirements
regarding length, structure, chemical composition and sequence in

The target recognition process is highly sequence specific, but not
all positions of a siRNA contribute equally to target recognition;
mismatches in the centre of the siRNA duplex prevent target RNA cleavage.
The position of the cleavage site in the target RNA is defined by
the 5' end of the guide siRNA rather than its 3' end. These results
provide a rational basis for the design of siRNAs in future gene

Hfq bound strongly to sodB mRNA and altered the structure of the
mRNA, partially opening a loop. This gives access to a sequence complementary
to RyhB and encompassing the translation initiation codon. RyhB binding
blocked the translation initiation codon of sodB and triggered the
degradation of both RyhB and sodB mRNA. Thus, Hfq is a critical chaperone
in vivo and in vitro, changing the folding of the target mRNA to
make it subject to the small RNA regulator.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity orchestrates the proper development of the neuronal circuitry by regulating both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression programmes. How these programmes are coordinated, however, is largely unknown. We found that the transcription of miR379-410, a large cluster of brain-specific microRNAs (miRNAs), is induced by increasing neuronal activity in primary rat neurons. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays suggest that binding of the transcription factor myocyte enhancing factor 2 (Mef2) upstream of miR379-410 is necessary and sufficient for activity-dependent transcription of the cluster. Mef2-induced expression of at least three individual miRNAs of the miR379-410 cluster is required for activity-dependent dendritic outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. One of these miRNAs, the dendritic miR-134, promotes outgrowth by inhibiting translation of the mRNA encoding for the translational repressor Pumilio2. In summary, we have described a novel regulatory pathway that couples activity-dependent transcription to miRNA-dependent translational control of gene expression during neuronal development.},

In this work, we describe the analysis of three members of the RNase D family of exonucleases (Rex1p, Rex2p and Rex3p). This work led to three important conclusions. First, each of these exonucleases is required for the processing of distinct RNAs. Specifically, Rex1p, Rex2p and Rex3p are required for 5S rRNA, U4 snRNA and MRP RNA trimming, respectively. Secondly, some 3' exonucleases are redundant with other exonucleases. Specifically, Rex1p and Rex2p function redundantly in 5.8S rRNA maturation, Rex1p, Rex2p and Rex3p are redundant for the processing of U5 snRNA and RNase P RNA, and Rex1p and the exonuclease Rrp6p have an unknown redundant essential function. Thirdly, the demonstration that the Rex proteins can affect reactions that have been attributed previously to the exosome complex indicates that an apparently simple processing step can be surprisingly complex with multiple exonucleases working sequentially in the same pathway.},

These antisense elements are located either in the 5' half or in the 3' end region of the snoRNA, and are followed by the conserved D' or D box motifs, respectively. An uninterrupted helix formed between the rRNA and the antisense element of the snoRNA, in conjunction with the adjacent D' or D box, constitute the recognition signal for the putative methyltransferase. Here, we have identified an additional essential box element common to methylation guide snoRNAs, termed the C' box. We show that the C' box functions in concert with the D' box and plays a crucial role in the methyltransfer reaction directed by the upstream antisense element and the D' box. We also show that an internal fragment of U24 methylation guide snoRNA, encompassing the upstream antisense element and the D' and C' box motifs, can support the site-specific methylation of rRNA. This strongly suggests that the C box of methylation guide snoRNAs plays an essential role in the methyltransfer reaction guided by the 3'-terminal antisense element and the D box of the snoRNA.},

The yeast snR30 'orphan' H/ACA snoRNA has long been known to function in the nucleolytic processing of 18S rRNA, but its molecular role remained unknown. Here, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrating that during pre-rRNA processing, two evolutionarily conserved sequence elements in the 3'-hairpin of snR30 base-pair with short pre-rRNA sequences located in the eukaryote-specific internal region of 18S rRNA. The newly discovered snR30-18S base-pairing interactions are essential for 18S rRNA production and they constitute a complex snoRNA target RNA transient structure that is novel to H/ACA RNAs.

The various box elements are essential for snoRNA production and for snoRNA-directed modification of rRNA nucleotides. In the case of the box C/D snoRNAs, boxes C and D and an adjoining stem form a vital structure, known as the box C/D motif. Here, we examined expression of natural and artificial box C/D snoRNAs in yeast and mammalian cells, to assess the role of the box C/D motif in snoRNA localization. The results demonstrate that the motif is necessary and sufficient for nucleolar targeting, both in yeast and mammals. Moreover, in mammalian cells, RNA is targeted to coiled bodies as well. Thus, the box C/D motif is the first intranuclear RNA trafficking signal identified for an RNA family. Remarkably, it also couples snoRNA localization with synthesis and, most likely, function. The distribution of snoRNA precursors in mammalian cells suggests that this coupling is provided by a specific protein(s) which binds the box C/D motif during or rapidly after snoRNA transcription. The conserved nature of the box C/D motif indicates that its role in coupling production and localization of snoRNAs is of ancient evolutionary origin.},

Plants were grown at 20 or 4°C until entering the reproductive stage and a cross-comparison on the leaf proteomes was performed. Quantitative analyses on protein alterations occurring upon low-temperature exposure showed a reinforcement in ascorbate recycling (dehydroascorbate reductase, ascorbate peroxidase) and protein processing (proteasome subunit, cysteine proteinase), as well as the accumulation of the enzyme devoted to tetrapyrrole resynthesis (glutamate semialdehyde aminomutase). In contrast, among proteins down-regulated after cold stress, we could identify some key Krebs cycle enzymes (isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase), together with many photosynthesis-related proteins (oxygen-evolving complex proteins, ATP synthase subunits, ferredoxin NADPH oxidoreductase and some Calvin cycle enzymes). Physiological and biochemical parameters (such as shoot apex dissection, chlorophyll, proline and sugar content determination) sustained proteomics findings allowing the present research to contribute to the current knowledge on these long-term responses, which may be crucial to stress adaptation under field conditions.},

The study was conducted in 14 lakes of the August{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\'{o}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}w Lakeland (central Europe, NE Poland) with different hydrological conditions, type of stratification and trophic status. The analyses were performed in the hydrological year 2013. In the waters of the studied lakes, the mean abundance of fungi was 5600±3600CFU/mL. The minimum value (800CFU/mL) was recorded for the mesotrophic P{\{}{\l}{\}}askie Lake, and the maximum value (14,000CFU/mL) was recorded for the eutrophic Pobojno Lake. A total of 38 species of fungi were identified, including 11 belonging to the aquatic hyphomycetes; up to 14 species were potentially pathogenic fungi. The potentially pathogenic fungi, particularly Candida albicans and Scopulariopsis fusca, were found in lakes with increased concentrations of chloride and sulphate(VI) ions and may thus serve as indicators of the degree of water pollution. This paper illustrates that the species diversity and abundance of fungi in limnic waters depend on the concentration of organic matter, chlorophyll a concentration, and the degree of water pollution. The results suggest that aquatic fungi can be a valuable indicator of the degree of pollution and the sanitary quality of the water.},

abstract = {The lin-4 and let-7 small temporal RNAs play a central role in controlling
the timing of Caenorhabditis elegans cell fate decisions. let-7 has
been conserved through evolution, and its expression correlates with
adult development in bilateral animals, including Drosophila [Nature
408 (2000), 86]. The best match for lin-4 in Drosophila, miR-125,
is also expressed during pupal and adult stages of Drosophila development
[Curr. Biol. 12 (2002), 735]. Here, we ask whether the steroid hormone
ecdysone induces let-7 or miR-125 expression at the onset of metamorphosis,
attempting to link a known temporal regulator in Drosophila with
the heterochronic pathway defined in C. elegans. We find that let-7
and miR-125 are coordinately expressed in late larvae and prepupae,
in synchrony with the high titer ecdysone pulses that initiate metamorphosis.
Unexpectedly, however, their expression is neither dependent on the
EcR ecdysone receptor nor inducible by ecdysone in cultured larval
organs. Although let-7 and miR-125 can be induced by ecdysone in
Kc tissue culture cells, their expression is significantly delayed
relative to that seen in the animal. let-7 and miR-125 are encoded
adjacent to one another in the genome, and their induction correlates
with the transient appearance of an approximately 500-nt RNA transcribed
from this region, providing a mechanism to explain their precise
coordinate regulation. We conclude that a common precursor RNA containing
both let-7 and miR-125 is induced independently of ecdysone in Drosophila,
raising the possibility of a temporal signal that is distinct from
the well-characterized ecdysone-EcR pathway.},

The effects on cell cycle, apoptosis and nucleotide pools were studied in cultures initiated at 37°C and temperature shifted to 30 °C after 48 hours. In control cultures maintained at 37 °C, viable cells continued to proliferate until the termination of the culture, however, temperature reduction caused a rapid decrease in the percent of cells in S phase and accumulation of cells in G-1. This was accompanied by a concurrent reduction in U ratio (UTO/UDP-GNAc), previously shown to be a sensitive indicator of growth rate. Culture viability was extended following temperature shift, as a result of delayed onset of apoptosis, however, once initiated, the rate and manner of cell death was similar to that observed at 37 °C. All nucleotide pools were similarly degraded at the time of apoptotic cell death. Temperature reduction to 30 °C did not decrease the energy charge of the cells, however, the overall rate of metabolism was reduced. The latter may be sufficient to extend culture viability via a reduction in toxic metabolites and/or limitation of nutrient deprivation. However, the possibility remains that the benefits of temperature reduction in terms of both viability and productivity are more directly associated with cultures spending extended time in G-1.},

A flurry of recent studies brought to light an unexplored proteome that is mainly translated from short ORFs in non-coding regions and from alternative ORFs (AltORFs) in reference genes. The detection of these small proteins and the elucidation of their functions remain challenging and open a new dimension of eukaryotic proteomes, including the birth of novel genes and proteins.},

abstract = {Quality control pathways for non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs and rRNAs are widespread. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, poly(A) polymerases target aberrant non-coding RNAs for degradation. In yeast, a nuclear complex that includes the poly(A) polymerase Trf4p works together with the exosome in degrading a broad array of non-coding RNAs, several of which are aberrant. Yeast also have additional pathways for the degradation of defective RNAs and other pathways may exist in higher eukaryotes. One possibility is that cells recognize specific, still undiscovered, features common to misfolded RNAs; however, an alternative is that RNA quality control proteins interact with relatively general RNA structures, whereas correctly folded RNAs are sequestered by specific RNA-binding proteins and thus protected from degradation. Recently available structures of protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in non-coding RNA quality control are providing a more detailed understanding of this process. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Radiation exposure causes upregulation of many key genes, and an inducible microhomology-mediated recombination pathway could be a potential mechanism of adaptive evolution in eukaryotes.

The introduction of oil or oil constituents into seawater leads to successive blooms of a relatively limited number of indigenous marine bacterial genera--Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, Thallassolituus, Cycloclasticus, Oleispira and a few others (the OHCB)--which are present at low or undetectable levels before the polluting event. The types of OHCB that bloom depend on the latitude/temperature, salinity, redox and other prevailing physical-chemical factors. These blooms result in the rapid degradation of many oil constituents, a process that can be accelerated further by supplementation with limiting nutrients. Genome sequencing and functional genomic analysis of Alcanivorax borkumensis, the paradigm of OHCB, has provided significant insights into the genomic basis of the efficiency and versatility of its hydrocarbon utilization, the metabolic routes underlying its special hydrocarbon diet, and its ecological success. These and other studies have revealed the potential of OHCB for multiple biotechnological applications that include not only oil pollution mitigation, but also biopolymer production and biocatalysis.},

abstract = {In order to characterize the functional diversity in CYP63 cluster of tandemly linked P450 genes (pc-1, pc-2, and pc-3) in Phanerochaete chrysosporium, here we report the functional characterization of pc-3 (CYP63A3), a newly cloned member of this group. pc-3 expression was favored in nutrient-limited versus nutrient-rich media in 3-6-day-old cultures and was upregulated by starch as a carbon source or by oxygenation of cultures. pc-3 was induced by various xenobiotics in defined nutrient-limited (3-9-fold) and nutrient-rich (2-5-fold) cultures. Particularly, a range of unsubstituted and substituted aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes and fatty acids) induced the expression under the two nutrient conditions albeit in a differential manner. Interestingly, pc-3 was also inducible by certain oxygenated mono aromatics (nitrophenol, benzoate, and resorcinol), lower molecular weight (2 to 4 ring size) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkali-treated lignin derivatives in nutrient-rich malt extract cultures. The study further establishes that the three CYP63 genes (CYP63A1, A2, and A3) are independently regulated despite being members of the tandem gene cluster with high gene structural similarity (13-14 introns) and protein sequence homology (59-85{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}). The pc-3 cDNA (1,812 bp) was expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein (approximately 74 kDa). This constitutes the first report on heterologous expression of a P450 monooxygenase enzyme from this model white-rot fungus.},

abstract = {Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are a group of regulatory RNA molecules normally without a protein-coding function. In recent years, the importance of sRNAs as mediators of gene expression in bacteria has begun to be recognized. More than 70 sRNAs have been known in Escherichia coli. However, little is known about sRNAs in Helicobacter pylori, a human pathogen associated with gastric diseases. Here, we systematically identified sRNAs in the H. pylori genome by a computational approach based on gene location, sequence conservation, promoter and terminator search, and secondary structure. Among a total of six candidate sRNAs initially predicted, two novel sRNAs (IG-443 and IG-524) were confirmed by Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Virtually, they were a class of natural antisense transcripts, which were complementary to partial sequences of the following genes: flagellar motor switch gene (fliM) and fumarase (fumC). Taken together, the results indicate that there exist novel sRNAs in H. pylori and these RNAs might play a potential role in regulating gene expression.},

@article{Wosten1999,
abstract = {Fungi are well known to the casual observer for producing water-repelling aerial moulds and elaborate fruiting bodies such as mushrooms and polypores. Filamentous fungi colonize moist substrates (such as wood) and have to breach the water–air interface to grow into the air. Animals and plants breach this interface by mechanical force. Here, we show that a filamentous fungus such as Schizophyllum commune first has to reduce the water surface tension before its hyphae can escape the aqueous phase to form aerial structures such as aerial hyphae or fruiting bodies. The large drop in surface tension (from 72 to 24 mJ m−2) results from self-assembly of a secreted hydrophobin (SC3) into a stable amphipathic protein film at the water-air interface. Other, but not all, surface-active molecules (that is, other class I hydrophobins and streptofactin from Streptomyces tendae) can substitute for SC3 in the medium. This demonstrates that hydrophobins not only have a function at the hyphal surface but also at the medium–air interface, which explains why fungi secrete large amounts of hydrophobin into their aqueous surroundings.},

abstract = {The phylogeny of insects, one of the most spectacular radiations of life on earth, has received considerable attention [1-3]. However, the evolutionary roots of one intriguing group of insects, the twisted-wing parasites (Strepsiptera), remain unclear despite centuries of study and debate [1, 2, 4-11]. Strepsiptera exhibit exceptional larval developmental features, consistent with a predicted step from direct (hemimetabolous) larval development to complete metamorphosis that could have set the stage for the spectacular radiation of metamorphic (holometabolous) insects [1, 12, 13]. Here we report the sequencing of a Strepsiptera genome and show that the analysis of sequence-based genomic data (comprising more than 18 million nucleotides from nearly 4,500 genes obtained from a total of 13 insect genomes), along with genomic metacharacters, clarifies the phylogenetic origin of Strepsiptera and sheds light on the evolution of holometabolous insect development. Our results provide overwhelming support for Strepsiptera as the closest living relatives of beetles (Coleoptera). They demonstrate that the larval developmental features of Strepsiptera, reminiscent of those of hemimetabolous insects, are the result of convergence. Our analyses solve the long-standing enigma of the evolutionary roots of Strepsiptera and reveal that the holometabolous mode of insect development is more malleable than previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

structure analyses of ribosomal subunits in 2000-2001. During the
past year, the trend toward determining the structure of large, complex

group I introns, A- and B-type ribonuclease P RNAs, a riboswitch-substrate
complex and other structures. The growing database of RNA structures,
coupled with efforts directed at the standardization of nomenclature
and classification of motifs, has resulted in the identification

motifs. Because a large proportion of RNA structure can now be shown
to be composed of these recurring structural motifs, a view of RNA
as a modular structure built from a combination of these building
blocks and tertiary linkers is beginning to emerge. At the same time,
however, more detailed analysis of water, metal, ligand and protein
binding to RNA is revealing the effect of these moieties on folding
and structure formation. The balance between the views of RNA structure
either as strictly a construct of preformed building blocks linked
in a limited number of ways or as a flexible polymer assuming a global

RNAs in a process called "RNA interference (RNAi)"[1-4]; this process
is called "posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS)" in plants [5-7].
Both classes of gene silencing have been reviewed extensively [8-13].
The duplex RNA becomes processed by Dicer [14] or another RNase III-like
enzyme to short dsRNA fragments of about 21-23 nucleotides (nt) [15],
which are incorporated in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)[16]
that directs target-specific RNA degradation [17, 18]. Here, we show
that different synthetic dsRNA cassettes, consisting of two 5'-phosphorylated
RNA strands of 22 nt each, can initiate RNAi in Drosophila embryos.
The cassettes were active at similar quantities required to initiate
RNAi by conventional dsRNA. Their sequence specificity was confirmed
using synthetic dsRNA cassettes for two different genes, Notch and
hedgehog; each time, only the relevant embryonic phenotype was observed.
Introduction of point mutations had only a moderate effect on the
silencing potential, indicating that the silencing machinery does
not require perfect sequence identity. 5'-phosphorylated synthetic
RNA was more active than its hydroxylated form. Substitution of either
RNA strand by DNA strongly reduced activity. Synthetic cassettes
of siRNA will provide a new tool to induce mutant phenotypes of genes
with unknown function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metazoan miRNAs regulate protein-coding genes by binding the 3' UTR of cognate mRNAs. Identifying targets for the 115 known C. elegans miRNAs is essential for understanding their function. RESULTS: By using a new version of PicTar and sequence alignments of three nematodes, we predict that miRNAs regulate at least 10{\%} of C. elegans genes through conserved interactions. We have developed a new experimental pipeline to assay 3' UTR-mediated posttranscriptional gene regulation via an endogenous reporter expression system amenable to high-throughput cloning, demonstrating the utility of this system using one of the most intensely studied miRNAs, let-7. Our expression analyses uncover several new potential let-7 targets and suggest a new let-7 activity in head muscle and neurons. To explore genome-wide trends in miRNA function, we analyzed functional categories of predicted target genes, finding that one-third of C. elegans miRNAs target gene sets are enriched for specific functional annotations. We have also integrated miRNA target predictions with other functional genomic data from C. elegans. CONCLUSIONS: At least 10{\%} of C. elegans genes are predicted miRNA targets, and a number of nematode miRNAs seem to regulate biological processes by targeting functionally related genes. We have also developed and successfully utilized an in vivo system for testing miRNA target predictions in likely endogenous expression domains. The thousands of genome-wide miRNA target predictions for nematodes, humans, and flies are available from the PicTar website and are linked to an accessible graphical network-browsing tool allowing exploration of miRNA target predictions in the context of various functional genomic data resources.},

abstract = {More than 60 small RNAs (sRNA) have been identified in E. coli. The functions of the majority of these sRNAs are still unclear. For the few sRNAs characterized, expression and functional studies indicate that they act under stress conditions. Here, we describe a novel E. coli chromosome locus that is part of the SOS response to DNA damage. This locus encodes two sRNAs, IstR-1 and IstR-2, and a toxic peptide, TisB, encoded by tisAB mRNA. Transcription of tisAB and istR-2 is SOS regulated, whereas IstR-1 is present throughout growth. IstR-1 inhibits toxicity by base-pairing to a short region in the tisAB mRNA. This antisense interaction entails RNase III-dependent cleavage, thereby inactivating the mRNA for translation. In the absence of the SOS response, IstR-1 is present in high excess over its target. However, SOS induction leads to depletion of the IstR-1 pool, concomitant with accumulation of tisAB mRNA. Under such conditions, TisB exerts its toxic effect, slowing down growth. We propose that the inhibitory sRNA prevents inadvertent TisB synthesis during normal growth and, possibly, also limits SOS-induced toxicity. Our study adds the SOS regulon to the growing list of global regulatory circuits controlled by sRNA genes.},

abstract = {This communication reviews the effects of short-chain carboxylic acids on human cells of importance to the periodontium. The central hypothesis is that these acids can alter both cell function and gene expression, and thus contribute to the initiation and prolongation of gingival inflammation. Short-chain carboxylic acids [CH3-(CH2)x-COOH, x {\{}{\textless}{\}} 3] are metabolic intermediates with a broad range of apparently paradoxical biological effects. For example, lactic acid (CH3-CHOH-COOH), a 3-carbon alpha-hydroxy-substituted acid, is widely recognized for its cariogenicity. Lactic acid, however, also occurs in tropical fruits, and is the active ingredient in a variety of anti-wrinkle creams developed by dermatologists. In marked contrast, the unsubstituted 3-carbon propionic acid (CH3-CH2-COOH) is used as a food preservative and is the active principle for one class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Interestingly, the addition of one carbon to propionic acid dramatically changes the biological effects. The unsubstituted 4-carbon butyric acid (CH3-CH2-CH2-COOH) is used by hematologists as a de-differentiating agent for the treatment of sickle cell anemia, but by oncologists as a differentiating agent for cancer chemotherapy. Finally, acting either individually or in concert, these acids can increase vascular dilation. Clearly, these acids, while metabolically derived, have a number of very divergent activities which are cell-type-specific (Fig. 1). It may be telling that periodontal bacteria produce these acids in millimolar concentrations, and that these bacteria can be characterized by their acid production profiles. It is no less interesting that these acids occur in the gingival crevices of human subjects with severe periodontal disease at millimolar levels which are {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 10-fold higher than those found in mildly diseased subjects, and are undetectable in healthy subjects. Further, when applied directly to healthy human gingiva, short-chain carboxylic acids stimulate a gingival inflammatory response and inflammatory cytokine release. At the cellular level, these acids inhibit proliferation of gingival epithelial and endothelial cells, and inhibit leukocyte apoptosis and function, but can stimulate leukocyte cytokine release. At the molecular level, these acids can stimulate neutrophil gene transcription, translation, and protein expression. Thus, the likelihood is high that these acids, in addition to their cariogenic activity, can promote and prolong gingival inflammation. Our challenge will be to identify the cell or cells of the periodontium which respond to short-chain carboxylic acids, to delineate their responses and the molecular mechanism(s) of these effects, and to categorize the aspects of the inflammatory components which damage and those which protect the host. With this information, it may be possible to begin to rationally identify and test pharmaceutical agents which diminish the harmful aspects, while enhancing the beneficial components, of the inflammatory response.},

wide range of organisms, and can play previously unsuspected critical
regulatory roles. The bacterial small RNAs include two major classes.
The largest family(with at least 20 members in Escherichia coli K12)
acts by base pairing with target mRNAs to modify mRNA translation
or stability; this class of RNAs also uses an RNA chaperone protein,
Hfq. DsrA is the best-studied example of this family of RNAs. It
has been shown to positively regulate translation of the transcription
factor RpoS by opening an inhibitory hairpin in the mRNA, and to
negatively regulate translation of hns by pairing just beyond the
translation initiation codon. The class of RNAs that modify activity
of proteins is exemplified by CsrB and CsrC of E. coli, two RNAs
that bind to and inhibit CsrA, a protein translational regulator.
Homologs of CsrA and related regulatory RNAs have been implicated
in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, biofilm formation,and virulence

end of the transcript harbors several evolutionarily conserved C/D
box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that are tissue-specifically expressed.
With the exception of 47 copies of HBII-52 snoRNAs, none of the snoRNAs
exhibit complementarity to known RNAs. Due to an 18-nucleotide sequence
complementarity, HBII-52 can bind to the alternatively spliced exon
Vb of the serotonin receptor 2C pre-mRNA, where it masks a splicing
silencer, which results in alternative exon usage. This silencer
can also be destroyed by RNA editing, which changes the amino acid
sequence and appears to be independent of HBII-52. Lack of HBII-52
expression in individuals with PWS causes most likely a lack of the
high-efficacy serotonin receptor, which could contribute to the disease.
It is therefore possible that snoRNAs could act as versatile modulators
of gene expression by modulating alternative splicing.},

There is a growing body of literature describing the involvement of carbohydrate groups in various aspects of fungal disease. Carbohydrates comprising the cell wall or capsule, or as a component of glycoproteins, are the fungal cell surface entities most likely to be exposed to the surrounding environment. Thus, the fungus-host interaction is likely to involve carbohydrates before DNA, RNA, or even protein. The interaction between fungal and host cells is also complex, and early studies using whole cells or crude cell fractions often produced seemingly conflicting results. What was needed, and what has been developing, is the ability to identify specific glycan structures and determine how they interact with immune system components. Carbohydrate analysis is complicated by the complexity of glycan structures and by the challenges of separating and detecting carbohydrates experimentally. Advances in carbohydrate chemistry have enabled us to move from the foundation of composition analysis to more rapid characterization of specific structures. This, in turn, will lead to a greater understanding of how fungi coexist with their hosts as commensals or exist in conflict as pathogens.},

The spectrum of diseases with which they are associated has also broadened and includes allergic disease, superficial and deep local infections, pneumonia, brain abscess, and disseminated infection. For some infections in immunocompetent individuals, such as allergic fungal sinusitis and brain abscess, they are among the most common etiologic fungi. Melanin is a likely virulence factor for these fungi. Diagnosis relies on careful microscopic and pathological examination, as well as clinical assessment of the patient, as these fungi are often considered contaminants. Therapy varies depending upon the clinical syndrome. Local infection may be cured with excision alone, while systemic disease is often refractory to therapy. Triazoles such as voriconazole, posaconazole, and itraconazole have the most consistent in vitro activity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) in human body fluids are emerging as effective biomarkers for detection of diseases. Saliva, as the most accessible and noninvasive body fluid, has been shown to harbor exRNA biomarkers for several human diseases. However, the entire spectrum of exRNA from saliva has not been fully characterized.

METHODS: Using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we conducted an in-depth bioinformatic analysis of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in human cell-free saliva (CFS) from healthy individuals, with a focus on microRNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs).

RESULTS: Our data demonstrated robust reproducibility of miRNA and piRNA profiles across individuals. Furthermore, individual variability of these salivary RNA species was highly similar to those in other body fluids or cellular samples, despite the direct exposure of saliva to environmental impacts. By comparative analysis of {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}90 RNA-Seq data sets of different origins, we observed that piRNAs were surprisingly abundant in CFS compared with other body fluid or intracellular samples, with expression levels in CFS comparable to those found in embryonic stem cells and skin cells. Conversely, miRNA expression profiles in CFS were highly similar to those in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Using a customized bioinformatics method, we identified {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}400 circRNAs in CFS.

abstract = {The current treatment method for PCDD/F-contaminated soil, which fulfils the requirements for POP soils, is incineration at high temperature. In this study, we investigated if bioaugmentation with fungal inoculum or treatment with manganese peroxidase (MnP) enzyme preparation could be used instead. The main source of PCDD/F contamination in Finland has been the national production and use of a chlorophenol containing wood preservative, which contained PCDD/Fs as impurities. Therefore, historically contaminated soils from three sawmill sites were used in the experiments. In bioaugmentation experiments with living fungal mycelia, enzyme production, CO2 production and degradation of chlorinated dioxins were measured. When cell free MnP preparation was added to the soil, it was likewise important to follow how enzyme activity was maintained in the soil. As a result of this study, we showed that fungi were able to efficiently degrade PCDD/F, but surprisingly the addition of MnP preparation did not have any effect to the PCDD/F concentration. However, substantial amounts of MnP activity were found in the soil still after 10d of incubation. Treatment with either Stropharia rugosoannulata or Phanerochaete velutina resulted in 62-64{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} decrease in WHO-TEQ value in 3months.

abstract = {We characterized 32 cold-adapted, psychrophilic and cold-tolerant, yeast strains isolated from alpine habitats with regard to their taxonomy, growth temperature profile, and ability to degrade phenol and 18 phenol-related mono-aromatic compounds at 10 degrees C. Twenty of the strains were identified by sequencing of the ribosomal ITS region as seven species of the basidiomycota: Cryptococcus terreus (three strains), Cryptococcus terricola (one strain), Rhodosporidium lusitaniae (two strains), Rhodotorula creatinivora (10 strains), Rhodotorula ingeniosa (one strain), Mastigobasidium intermedium (one strain), and Sporobolomyces roseus (two strains). Twelve strains sharing closely related ITS sequences could not be identified to the species level; according to their ITS sequence they are included in the Microbotryomycetidae. These 12 strains were psychrophilic (no growth at temperatures above 20 degrees C); one-third of these strains did not grow above 15 degrees C. None of the 32 strains utilized any of the highly volatile mono-aromatic compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, nitrobenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene) as the sole carbon source. Non/low volatile aromatic compounds were degraded in the following order: phenol{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}hydroquinone{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}resorcinol{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}benzoate{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}catechol{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}salicylate{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}p-cresol{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}m-cresol. o-Cresol, guaiacol, p-nitrophenol, or p-nitrotoluene were not utilized for growth. R. creatinivora strains degraded up to seven compounds, whereas C. terricola and S. roseus strains degraded only two compounds. The toxicity of the compounds was determined via growth inhibition in the presence of toxicants and nutrients at 10 degrees C. R. creatinivora strains were characterized by higher IC50 values than other species, S. roseus was the most sensitive species. The most toxic compounds were the xylene isomers, ethylbenzene, p-nitrophenol, and m-cresol. There was a relation between the chemical structure of the compounds and their toxicity, whereas a relation between the toxicity of the compounds and the ability of the yeasts strains to utilize these compounds for growth was only detected in some cases.},

Three types of soils, organic-rich soil (Andosol), organic-poor soil (Granitic Regosols), and paddy soil, were used for the construction of artificially contaminated soil to understand the influence of the soil property on fungal growth and dioxin degradation ability. Under a solid-state condition, although the growth of the fungus improved in organic-rich soil, the degradation of 2,7-DCDD was inhibited. Although the degradation of 1,3,6,8-TCDD under a solid-state condition was inhibited severely, 1,3,6,8-TCDD degradation was observed under a slurry-state condition in organic-poor soil. In the case of organic-rich soil, an increase in water content improved the 1,3,6,8-TCDD degradation efficiency.

Evidence of the occurrence of natural attenuation within the BTEX plume includes: (1) decrease of DO, nitrate, sulfate, and redox potential, (2) production of dissolved ferrous iron, sulfide, methane, and CO(2), (3) decreased BTEX concentrations along the transport path, (4) increased microbial populations, and (5) limited spreading of the BTEX plume. Field results also reveal that the operation of biosparging caused the shifting of anaerobic conditions inside the plume to aerobic conditions. This variation can be confirmed by the following field observations inside the plume due to the biosparging process: (1) increase in DO, redox potential, nitrate, and sulfate, (2) decrease dissolved ferrous iron, sulfide, and methane, (3) increased total cultivable heterotrophs, and (4) decreased total cultivable anaerobes as well as methanogens. Results of polymerase chain reaction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and nucleotide sequence analysis reveal that three BTEX biodegraders (Candidauts magnetobacterium, Flavobacteriales bacterium, and Bacteroidetes bacterium) might exist at this site. Results show that more than 70{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of BTEX has been removed through the biosparging system within a 10-month remedial period at an averaged groundwater temperature of 18 degrees C. This indicates that biosparging is a promising technology to remediate BTEX contaminated groundwater.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic Hsp60 cytoplasmic chaperonin CCT (chaperonin containing the T-complex polypeptide-1) is essential for growth in budding yeast, and mutations in individual CCT subunits have been shown to affect assembly of tubulin and actin. The present research focused mainly on the expression of the CCT subunits, CCTalpha and CCTbeta, in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Previous studies showed that, unlike most other chaperones, CCT in yeast does not undergo induction following heat shock. In this study, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels of CCT subunits following exposure to low temperatures, were examined. The Northern blot analysis indicated a 3- to 4-fold increase in mRNA levels of CCTalpha and CCTbeta genes after cold shock at 4 degrees C. Interestingly, Western blot analysis showed that cold shock induces an increase in the CCTalpha protein, which is expressed at 10 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C. Transfer of 4 degrees C cold-shocked cells to 10 degrees C induced a 5-fold increase in the CCTalpha protein level. By means of fluorescent immunostaining and confocal microscopy, we found CCTalpha to be localized in the cortex and the cell cytoplasm of S. cerevisiae. Localization of CCTalpha was not affected at low temperatures. Co-localization of CCT and filaments of actin and tubulin was not observed by microscopy. The induction pattern of the CCTalpha protein suggests that expression of the chaperonin may be primarily important during the recovery from low temperatures and the transition to growth at higher temperatures, as found for other Hsps during the recovery phase from heat shock.},

abstract = {Protection by melanin depends on its subcellular location. Although most filamentous fungi synthesize melanin via a polyketide synthase pathway, where and how melanin biosynthesis occurs and how it is deposited as extracellular granules remain elusive. Using a forward genetic screen in the pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, we find that mutations in an endosomal sorting nexin abolish melanin cell-wall deposition. We find that all enzymes involved in the early steps of melanin biosynthesis are recruited to endosomes through a non-conventional secretory pathway. In contrast, late melanin enzymes accumulate in the cell wall. Such subcellular compartmentalization of the melanin biosynthetic machinery occurs in both A. fumigatus and A. nidulans. Thus, fungal melanin biosynthesis appears to be initiated in endosomes with exocytosis leading to melanin extracellular deposition, much like the synthesis and trafficking of mammalian melanin in endosomally derived melanosomes.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are genes involved in normal development and cancer. They inhibit gene expression by associating with 3'-Untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and are thought to regulate a large proportion of protein coding genes. However, it is becoming apparent that miRNA activity is not necessarily always determined by its expression in the cell. MiRNA activity can be affected by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). For example, the RNA-binding protein HuR associates with the 3'UTR of the CAT1 mRNA after stress, counteracting the effect of miR-122. Second, we found that the expression of an RNA-binding protein called Dead end (Dnd1) prohibits the function of several miRNAs by blocking the accessibility of target mRNAs.(2) Dnd1 function is essential for proper development of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in zebrafish and mammals, indicating a crucial role for RBP/miRNA interplay on 3'UTRs of mRNAs in developmental decisions. In this perspective we discuss the interplay between RBPs and miRNAs in the context of germ cells and review current observations implicating RBPs in miRNA function.},

The RNA acts as a true catalyst under these conditions whereas the protein moieties of the enzymes alone show no catalytic activity. However, in buffers containing 5-10 mM Mg2+ (in the absence of spermidine) both kinds of subunits are required for enzymatic activity, as shown previously. In the presence of low concentrations of Mg2+, in vitro, the RNA and protein subunits from one species can complement subunits from the other species in reconstitution experiments. When the precursor to E. coli 4.5S RNA is used as a substrate, only the enzyme complexes formed with M1 RNA from E. coli and the protein moieties from either bacterial species are active.},

abstract = {In the macronuclear rRNA genes of Tetrahymena thermophila, a 413 bp intervening sequence (IVS) interrupts the 26S rRNA-coding region. A restriction fragment of the rDNA containing the IVS and portions of the adjacent rRNA sequences (exons) was inserted downstream from the lac UV5 promoter in a recombinant plasmid. Transcription of this template by purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vitro produced a shortened version of the pre-rRNA, which was then deproteinized. When incubated with monovalent and divalent cations and a guanosine factor, this RNA underwent splicing. The reactions that were characterized included the precise excision of the IVS, attachment of guanosine to the 5' end of the IVS, covalent cyclization of the IVS and ligation of the exons. We conclude that splicing activity is intrinsic to the structure of the RNA, and that enzymes, small nuclear RNAs and folding of the pre-rRNA into an RNP are unnecessary for these reactions. We propose that the IVS portion of the RNA has several enzyme-like properties that enable it to break and reform phosphodiester bonds. The finding of autocatalytic rearrangements of RNA molecules has implications for the mechanism and the evolution of other reactions that involve RNA.},

abstract = {In metazoans, most microRNAs imperfectly base-pair with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNAs and prevent protein accumulation by either repressing translation or inducing mRNA degradation. Examples of specific mRNAs undergoing microRNA-mediated repression are numerous, but whether the repression is a reversible process remains largely unknown. Here we show that cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1) mRNA and reporters bearing its 3'UTR can be relieved from the microRNA miR-122-induced inhibition in human hepatocarcinoma cells subjected to different stress conditions. The derepression of CAT-1 mRNA is accompanied by its release from cytoplasmic processing bodies and its recruitment to polysomes. The derepression requires binding of HuR, an AU-rich-element binding protein, to the 3'UTR of CAT-1 mRNA. We propose that proteins interacting with the 3'UTR will generally act as modifiers altering the potential of miRNAs to repress gene expression.},

abstract = {The Tetrahymena thermophila ribosomal RNA gene contains an intervening sequence (IVS), which is transcribed as part of the precursor RNA and subsequently removed by splicing. We have found previously that the IVS is excised as a 0.4 kb RNA in isolated nuclei. We now report the finding of a novel RNA molecule, which is an electrophoretic variant (EV) of this 0.4 kb IVS RNA. The EV was identified as a form of the IVS RNA by Southern hybridization, RNA fingerprinting and R-loop mapping. A pulse-chase experiment established that in vitro the excised IVS RNA is converted to the EV by a post-splicing event. This conversion is enhanced at 39 degrees C compared to 30 degrees C and is irreversible under our experimental conditions. The EV of the IVS is a circular RNA. This structure was first suggested by its anomalous electrophoretic mobility on denaturing compared to nondenaturing gels. When the EV was prepared for electron microscopy under totally denaturing conditions, 0.4 kb circular molecules were observed. Furthermore, we have converted the circular form to a linear form by limited T1 RNAase digestion. The circular RNA survived treatment with DNAase, protease, glyoxal and various denaturants, which suggests that it is a covalently closed RNA circle.},

The model is supported by mutations showing that: (1) reducing the complementarity between the snoRNA and rRNA disrupts psi formation, and (2) altering the distance between the ACA box and target uridine causes an adjacent uridine to be modified. This discovery implies that most snoRNAs function in targeting nucleotide modification in rRNA: ribose methylation for the box C/D snoRNAs and psi formation for the ACA snoRNAs.},

Upon return to 37{\{}degrees{\}}C, some of the interphase cells developed a fragmented nuclear morphology, and the fraction of cells exhibiting this effect reached 40{\%} after entering the first mitosis. About 50{\%} of the mitotic cells accumulated with Colcemid at the second mitosis exhibited premature chromosome condensation (metaphase-associated PCC) in an amount equal to approximately one to two chromosomes per diploid cell. There was also a low frequency of spontaneous S and G2 PCC (0.5 to 1.5{\%} in controls); this distinctly different type of PCC was observed in heated interphase cells at a frequency of 2.0 to 7.0{\%} before the first wave of entry into mitosis. Heated S-phase cells exhibited a chromosome break frequency of about 0.9 breaks per cell when analyzed at the first mitosis. This value agrees well with the observed surviving fraction of 40{\%}, if we assume that one break per cell is a lethal event, and that chromosome damage has a Poisson frequency distribution in the cell population; however, this correlation may not be valid for tumor cell populations. Between the first and second mitoses, an increase in hyperthermia-induced aneuploidy was observed which was apparently due to unequal division, since mitotic cells containing PCC were excluded from the chromosome number frequency analyses. Although this induction of aneuploidy was observed independently of PCC, we conclude that abnormal division is necessary for both effects, and both PCC and unequal division result in an increase in aneuploidy. Previous studies using transmission electron microscopy demonstrated a precocious reformation of the nuclear membrane around metaphase chromosomes in Chinese hamster ovary cells heated at this temperature (R. A. Coss et al., Cancer Res., 39: 1911-1918, 1979). We suggest that such heat-induced changes in nuclear envelope formation lead to nuclear fragmentation and ultimately result in metaphase-associated PCC.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES SHOWED THAT DELAYED RECTIFIER POTASSIUM
CURRENTS EXISTED IN HUMAN GASTRIC CANCER CELLS AND THE CURRENTS WERE
RELATED TO THE GROWTH OF GASTRIC CANCER CELLS. HUMAN ETHER-A-GO-GO-RELATED
GENE (HERG) ENCODING ALPHA SUBUNIT OF DELAYED RECTIFIER POTASSIUM
CHANNEL HAS BEEN INDICATED WITH INVOLVEMENT IN TUMOR CELL GROWTH
AND DEATH. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE
EXPRESSION OF HERG PROTEIN IN GASTRIC CANCER TISSUE AND CELLS; ANALYZE
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXPRESSION OF HERG PROTEIN AND THE CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS WITH GASTRIC CANCER; EXPLORE THE EFFECTS
OF HERG PROTEIN ON BIOLOGICAL BEHAVIOURS OF GASTRIC CANCER CELLS.
METHODS: THE EXPRESSION OF HERG PROTEIN IN GASTRIC CANCER TISSUES
AND CELLS WAS MEASURED BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND WESTERN BLOT,
RESPECTIVELY. REDUCTION OF HERG PROTEIN WAS CARRIED OUT BY SIRNA
TECHNOLOGY. THE PROLIFERATION, ABILITY OF CLONE FORMATION, CELL CYCLE,
APOPTOSIS AND INVASIVE ABILITY OF GASTRIC CANCER CELLS WERE EVALUATED
BY MTT ASSAY, CLONE FORMATION ASSAY, FLOW CYTOMETRY AND CELL INVASION
ASSAY. TUMOR GROWTH IN NUDE MICE WAS TO BE USED TO ACCESS THE TUMORIGENICITY
OF GASTRIC CANCER CELLS AND HERG CURRENTS WERE RECORDED BY PATCH-CLAMP.
RESULTS: HERG PROTEIN WAS EXCLUSIVELY EXPRESSED IN GASTRIC CANCER
CELLS. THE EXPRESSION OF HERG PROTEIN WAS ASSOCIATED WITH TUMOR DIFFERENTIATION,
TNM STAGE AND LYMPH NODE INVOLVEMENT OF GASTRIC CANCER. SILENCING
HERG PROTEIN COULD ELIMINATE THE HERG CURRENTS AND INHIBIT PROLIFERATION,
CLONE FORMATION, INVASIVENESS AND TUMORIGENICITY OF GASTRIC CANCER
CELLS. REDUCING HERG PROTEIN COULD ALSO INHIBIT GASTRIC CANCER CELLS
ENTERING S PHASE FROM G(1) PHASE AND INDUCE APOPTOSIS OF GASTRIC
CANCER CELLS. CONCLUSION: HERG PROTEIN IS INVOLVED IN CARCINOGENESIS
OF GASTRIC CANCER AND IS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGET OF GASTRIC

abstract = {A most-probable-number (MPN) procedure was developed to separately enumerate aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria, because most of the currently available methods are unable to distinguish between these two groups. Separate 96-well microtiter plates are used to estimate the sizes of these two populations. The alkane-degrader MPN method uses hexadecane as the selective growth substrate and positive wells are detected by reduction of iodonitrotetrazolium violet, which is added after incubation for 2 weeks at 20 degrees C. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degraders are grown on a mixture of phenanthrene, anthracene, fluorene, and dibenzothiophene in a second plate. Positive wells turn yellow to greenish-brown from accumulation of the partial oxidation products of the aromatic substrates and they can be scored after a 3-week incubation period. These MPN procedures are accurate and selective. For pure cultures, heterotrophic plate counts on a nonselective medium and the appropriate MPN procedure provide similar estimates of the population density. Bacteria that cannot grow on the selective substrates do not produce false positive responses even when the inoculum density is very high. Thus, this method, which is simple enough for use in the field, provides reliable estimates for the density and composition of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Filamentous fungal infections (FFI) seem to become more frequent in burn patients, in whom they are usually accepted to cause severe. However published data regarding their incidence and consequences in that context remain scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of mould infections in our burn centre, and to review characteristics and outcomes of patients with such infections.

METHODS: This retrospective single-centre study reviews all patients admitted in our centre with acute burns (2000-2011) and positive culture for moulds. Wound infections were defined as follows: fungal wound colonisations (FWC) for positive mycological cultures without signs of wound infection; fungal wound infections (FWI) for positive mycological cultures with local signs of wound infection; disseminated infection (DI) for FWI with a positive blood culture or a positive galactomannan (for aspergillosis) or severe sepsis or secondary organ localisation(s).

RESULTS: Among 1849 patients, 31 patients presented a FFI. For 29 patients (93{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}), positive fungal samples were cutaneous: 20 Aspergillosis ASP (5 FWC, 8 FWI and 7 DI), 9 mucormycosis MMC (3 FWC and 6 FWI) and 3 fusariosis FUS (3 FWI). Two patients presented a catheter colonisation or a pulmonary colonisation (Aspergillus fumigatus). Incidence of FFI was 1.7{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}. Total body surface area burned, full-thickness burn surface area, Unit Burn Standard, Tobiasen score and SAPS2 (respectively 55{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} [40-73], 45{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} [30-63], 180 [129-259], 11 [8-12] and 50 [40-62]) were markedly higher than in burned patients without FFI hospitalised during the same time period. 30{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of the patients with burn wound ASP (6/22) died. Mean length of stay was 111±67 days.

CONCLUSION: FFI are essentially cutaneous, infrequent and occur in the most severe burned patients. ASP seems to be more serious than other FFI.},

Glutathione depletion and prevention of glutathione synthesis by buthionine sulfoximine resulted in inhibition of the development of thermotolerance and a decrease in total protein as well as specific heat stress proteins. While the degree of inhibition of thermotolerance was similar for both glutathione depletion protocols, inhibition in heat stress protein synthesis was greater when glutathione was depleted to low levels prior to heating.

In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of many error-correction methods, and establish a common set of benchmark data and evaluation criteria to provide a comparative assessment. We present experimental results on quality, run-time, memory usage and scalability of several error-correction methods.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The sequencing, de novo assembly and annotation of transcriptome datasets generated with next generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled biologists to answer genomic questions in non-model species with unprecedented ease. Reliable and accurate de novo assembly and annotation of transcriptomes, however, is a critically important step for transcriptome assemblies generated from short read sequences. Typical benchmarks for assembly and annotation reliability have been performed with model species. To address the reliability and accuracy of de novo transcriptome assembly in non-model species, we generated an RNAseq dataset for an intertidal gastropod mollusc species, Nerita melanotragus, and compared the assembly produced by four different de novo transcriptome assemblers; Velvet, Oases, Geneious and Trinity, for a number of quality metrics and redundancy.

RESULTS: Transcriptome sequencing on the Ion Torrent PGM™ produced 1,883,624 raw reads with a mean length of 133 base pairs (bp). Both the Trinity and Oases de novo assemblers produced the best assemblies based on all quality metrics including fewer contigs, increased N50 and average contig length and contigs of greater length. Overall the BLAST and annotation success of our assemblies was not high with only 15-19{\%} of contigs assigned a putative function.

CONCLUSIONS: We believe that any improvement in annotation success of gastropod species will require more gastropod genome sequences, but in particular an increase in mollusc protein sequences in public databases. Overall, this paper demonstrates that reliable and accurate de novo transcriptome assemblies can be generated from short read sequencers with the right assembly algorithms.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The H/ACA family of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)
plays a central role in guiding the pseudouridylation of ribosomal
RNA (rRNA). In an effort to systematically identify the complete
set of rRNA-modifying H/ACA snoRNAs from the genome sequence of the
budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed a program -
Fisher - and previously presented several candidate snoRNAs based
on our analysis 1. FINDINGS: In this report, we provide a brief update
of this work, which was aborted after the publication of experimentally-identified
snoRNAs 2 identical to candidates we had identified bioinformatically
using Fisher. Our motivation for revisiting this work is to report
on the status of the candidate snoRNAs described in 1, and secondly,
to report that a modified version of Fisher together with the available
multiple yeast genome sequences was able to correctly identify several
H/ACA snoRNAs for modification sites not identified by the snoGPS
program 3. While we are no longer developing Fisher, we briefly consider
the merits of the Fisher algorithm relative to snoGPS, which may
be of use for workers considering pursuing a similar search strategy
for the identification of small RNAs. The modified source code for
Fisher is made available as supplementary material. CONCLUSION: Our
results confirm the validity of using minimum free energy (MFE) secondary
structure prediction to guide comparative genomic screening for RNA
families with few sequence constraints.},

from the Kyushu area for 11 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
markers distributed in the SLC1A2 region using the direct sequencing
and pyrosequencing methods, and examined allele, genotype and haplotype
association with schizophrenia.The positive finding observed in the
Kyushu samples was re-examined using 100 Japanese schizophrenics
and 100 controls recruited from the Aichi area.RESULTS:We found significant
differences in genotype and allele frequencies of SNP2 between cases
and controls (P = 0.013 and 0.008, respectively). After Bonferroni
corrections, the two significant differences disappeared. We tested
haplotype associations for all possible combinations of SNP pairs.
SNP2 showed significant haplotype associations with the disease (P
= 9.4 x 10-5, P = 0.0052 with Bonferroni correction, at the lowest)
in 8 combinations. Moreover, the significant haplotype association
of SNP2-SNP7 was replicated in the cumulative analysis of our two
sample sets.CONCLUSION:We concluded that at least one susceptibility
locus for schizophrenia is probably located within or nearby SLC1A2
in the Japanese population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wangiella dermatitidis is a human pathogenic fungus that is an etiologic agent of phaeohyphomycosis. W. dermatitidis produces a black pigment that has been identified as a dihydroxynaphthalene melanin and the production of this pigment is associated with its virulence. Cell wall pigmentation in W. dermatitidis depends on the WdPKS1 gene, which encodes a polyketide synthase required for generating the key precursor for dihydroxynaphthalene melanin biosynthesis.

RESULTS: We analyzed the effects of disrupting WdPKS1 on dihydroxynaphthalene melanin production and resistance to antifungal compounds. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that wdpks1Delta-1 yeast had thinner cell walls that lacked an electron-opaque layer compared to wild-type cells. However, digestion of the wdpks1Delta-1 yeast revealed small black particles that were consistent with a melanin-like compound, because they were acid-resistant, reacted with melanin-binding antibody, and demonstrated a free radical signature by electron spin resonance analysis. Despite lacking the WdPKS1 gene, the mutant yeast were capable of catalyzing the formation of melanin from L-3,4-dihyroxyphenylalanine. The wdpks1Delta-1 cells were significantly more susceptible to killing by voriconazole, amphotericin B, NP-1 [a microbicidal peptide], heat and cold, and lysing enzymes than the heavily melanized parental or complemented strains.

CONCLUSION: In summary, W. dermatitidis makes WdPKS-dependent and -independent melanins, and the WdPKS1-dependent deposition of melanin in the cell wall confers protection against antifungal agents and environmental stresses. The biological role of the WdPKS-independent melanin remains unclear.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invasion of host tissue by the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans is an important step during the development of candidosis. However, not all C. albicans strains possess the same invasive and virulence properties. For example, the two clinical isolates SC5314 and ATCC10231 differ in their ability to invade host tissue and cause experimental infections. Strain SC5314 is invasive whereas strain ATCC10231 is non-invasive and strongly attenuated in virulence compared to SC5314. In this study we compare the in vitro phenotypic, transcriptional and genomic profiles of these two widely used laboratory strains in order to determine the principal biological and genetic properties responsible for their differential virulence.

RESULTS: In all media tested, the two strains showed the same metabolic flexibility, stress resistance, adhesion properties and hydrolytic enzyme secretion in vitro. However, differences were observed in response to cell-surface disturbing agents and alkaline pH. Furthermore, reduced hyphal formation in strain ATCC10231 under certain conditions correlated with reduced invasive properties in an in vitro invasion assay and a reduced ability to invade epithelial tissue. Despite these diverse phenotypic properties, no substantial genomic differences were detected by comparative genome hybridisation within the open reading frames. However, in vitro transcriptional profiling displayed major differences in the gene expression of these two strains, even under normal in vitro growth conditions.

CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the reason for differential virulence of C. albicans strains is not due to the absence of specific genes, but rather due to differences in the expression, function or activity of common genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: micF RNA, a small regulatory RNA found in bacteria, post-transcriptionally
regulates expression of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) by interaction
with the ompF mRNA 5'UTR. Phylogenetic data can be useful for RNA/RNA
duplex structure analyses and aid in elucidation of mechanism of
regulation. However micF and associated genes, ompF and ompC are
difficult to annotate because of either similarities or divergences
in nucleotide sequence. We report by using sequences that represent
{\#}gene{\#}{\#}signatures{\#} as probes, e.g., mRNA 5'UTR sequences, closely
related genes can be accurately located in genomic sequences. RESULTS:
Alignment and search methods using NCBI BLAST programs have been
used to identify micF, ompF and ompC in Yersinia pestis and Yersinia
enterocolitica. By alignment with DNA sequences from other bacterial
species, 5' start sites of genes and upstream transcriptional regulatory
sites in promoter regions were predicted. Annotated genes from Yersinia
species provide phylogenetic information on the micF regulatory system.
High sequence conservation in binding sites of transcriptional regulatory
factors are found in the promoter region upstream of micF and conservation
in blocks of sequences as well as marked sequence variation is seen
in segments of the micF RNA gene. Unexpected large differences in
rates of evolution were found between the interacting RNA transcripts,
micF RNA and the 5' UTR of the ompF mRNA. micF RNA/ompF mRNA 5' UTR
duplex structures were modeled by the mfold program. Functional domains
such as RNA/RNA interacting sites appear to display a minimum of
evolutionary drift in sequence with the exception of a significant
change in Y. enterocolitica micF RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Newly annotated
Yersinia micF and ompF genes and the resultant RNA/RNA duplex structures
add strong phylogenetic support for a generalized duplex model. The
alignment and search approach using 5' UTR signatures may be a model
to help define other genes and their start sites when annotated genes
are available in well-defined reference organisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide analysis was performed to assess the transcriptional landscape of germinating A. niger conidia using both next generation RNA-sequencing and GeneChips. The metabolism of storage compounds during conidial germination was also examined and compared to the transcript levels from associated genes. RESULTS: The transcriptome of dormant conidia was shown to be highly differentiated from that of germinating conidia and major changes in response to environmental shift occurred within the first hour of germination. The breaking of dormancy was associated with increased transcript levels of genes involved in the biosynthesis of proteins, RNA turnover and respiratory metabolism. Increased transcript levels of genes involved in metabolism of nitrate at the onset of germination implies its use as a source of nitrogen. The transcriptome of dormant conidia contained a significant component of antisense transcripts that changed during germination. CONCLUSION: Dormant conidia contained transcripts of genes involved in fermentation, gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate cycle. The presence of such transcripts in dormant conidia may indicate the generation of energy from non-carbohydrate substrates during starvation-induced conidiation or for maintenance purposes during dormancy. The immediate onset of metabolism of internal storage compounds after the onset of germination, and the presence of transcripts of relevant genes, suggest that conidia are primed for the onset of germination. For some genes, antisense transcription is regulated in the transition from resting conidia to fully active germinants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Annotating mammalian genomes for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) is nontrivial since far from all ncRNAs are known and the computational models are resource demanding. Currently, the human genome holds the best mammalian ncRNA annotation, a result of numerous efforts by several groups. However, a more direct strategy is desired for the increasing number of sequenced mammalian genomes of which some, such as the pig, are relevant as disease models and production animals. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive annotation of structured RNAs in the pig genome. Combining sequence and structure similarity search as well as class specific methods, we obtained a conservative set with a total of 3,391 structured RNA loci of which 1,011 and 2,314, respectively, hold strong sequence and structure similarity to structured RNAs in existing databases. The RNA loci cover 139 cis-regulatory element loci, 58 lncRNA loci, 11 conflicts of annotation, and 3,183 ncRNA genes. The ncRNA genes comprise 359 miRNAs, 8 ribozymes, 185 rRNAs, 638 snoRNAs, 1,030 snRNAs, 810 tRNAs and 153 ncRNA genes not belonging to the here fore mentioned classes . When running the pipeline on a local shuffled version of the genome, we obtained no matches at the highest confidence level. Additional analysis of RNA-seq data from a pooled library from 10 different pig tissues added another 165 miRNA loci, yielding an overall annotation of 3,556 structured RNA loci. This annotation represents our best effort at making an automated annotation. To further enhance the reliability, 571 of the 3,556 structured RNAs were manually curated by methods depending on the RNA class while 1,581 were declared as pseudogenes. We further created a multiple alignment of pig against 20 representative vertebrates, from which RNAz predicted 83,859 de novo RNA loci with conserved RNA structures. 528 of the RNAz predictions overlapped with the homology based annotation or novel miRNAs. We further present a substantial synteny analysis which includes 1,004 lineage specific de novo RNA loci and 4 ncRNA loci in the known annotation specific for Laurasiatheria (pig, cow, dolphin, horse, cat, dog, hedgehog). CONCLUSIONS: We have obtained one of the most comprehensive annotations for structured ncRNAs of a mammalian genome, which is likely to play central roles in both health modelling and production. The core annotation is available in Ensembl 70 and the complete annotation is available at http://rth.dk/resources/rnannotator/susscr102/version1.02.},

Chicken snoRNAs have been very poorly characterized when compared to other vertebrate snoRNAs. A genome-wide analysis of chicken snoRNAs is therefore of great importance to further understand the functional evolution of snoRNAs in vertebrates. RESULTS: Two hundred and one gene variants encoding 93 box C/D and 62 box H/ACA snoRNAs were identified in the chicken genome and are predicted to guide 86 2'-O-ribose methylations and 69 pseudouridylations of rRNAs and spliceosomal RNAs. Forty-four snoRNA clusters were grouped into four categories based on synteny characteristics of the clustered snoRNAs between chicken and human. Comparative analyses of chicken snoRNAs revealed extensive recombination and separation of guiding function, with cooperative evolution between the guiding duplexes and modification sites. The gas5-like snoRNA host gene appears to be a hotspot of snoRNA gene expansion in vertebrates. Our results suggest that the chicken is a good model for the prediction of functional snoRNAs, and that intragenic duplication and divergence might be the major driving forces responsible for expansion of novel snoRNA genes in the chicken genome. CONCLUSION: We have provided a detailed catalog of chicken snoRNAs that aids in understanding snoRNA gene repertoire differences between avians and other vertebrates. Our genome-wide analysis of chicken snoRNAs improves annotation of the 'darkness matter' in the npcRNA world and provides a unique perspective into snoRNA evolution in vertebrates.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that non-protein-coding RNAs (npcRNAs/ncRNAs) play important roles during eukaryotic development, species evolution, and in the etiology of disease. Rhesus macaques are the most widely used primate model in both biomedical research and primate evolutionary studies. However, most reports on these animals focus on the functional roles of protein-coding sequences, whereas very little is known about macaque ncRNAs. RESULTS: In the present study, we performed the first systematic profiling of intermediate-size ncRNAs (50 to 500 nt) from the rhesus monkey by constructing a cDNA library. We identified 117 rhesus monkey ncRNAs, including 80 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), 29 other types of known RNAs (snRNAs, Y RNA, and others), and eight unclassified ncRNAs. Comparative genomic analysis and northern blot hybridizations demonstrated that some snoRNAs were lineage- or species-specific. Paralogous sequences were found for most rhesus monkey snoRNAs, the expression of which might be attributable to extensive duplication within the rhesus monkey genome. Further investigation of snoRNA flanking sequences showed that some rhesus monkey snoRNAs are retrogenes derived from L1-mediated integration. Finally, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that birds and primates share some snoRNAs and host genes thereof, suggesting that both the relevant host genes and the snoRNAs contained therein may be inherited from a common ancestor. However, some rhesus monkey snoRNAs hosted by non-ribosome-related genes appeared after the evolutionary divergence between birds and mammals. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first experimentally-derived catalog of rhesus monkey ncRNAs and uncover some interesting genomic and evolutionary features. These findings provide important information for future functional characterization of snoRNAs during primate evolution.},

In addition, the annotated genome can be browsed in an environment that supports comparative analysis with the annotated genomes maintained in the SEED environment.The service normally makes the annotated genome available within 12-24 hours of submission, but ultimately the quality of such a service will be judged in terms of accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the produced annotations. We summarize our attempts to address these issues and discuss plans for incrementally enhancing the service.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In bacteria, non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are crucial regulators of gene expression, controlling various stress responses, virulence, and motility. Previous work revealed a relatively high number of ncRNAs in some marine cyanobacteria. However, for efficient genetic and biochemical analysis it would be desirable to identify a set of ncRNA candidate genes in model cyanobacteria that are easy to manipulate and for which extended mutant, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets are available. RESULTS: Here we have used comparative genome analysis for the biocomputational prediction of ncRNA genes and other sequence/structure-conserved elements in intergenic regions of the three unicellular model cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC6803, Synechococcus elongatus PCC6301 and Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP1 plus the toxic Microcystis aeruginosa NIES843. The unfiltered numbers of predicted elements in these strains is 383, 168, 168, and 809, respectively, combined into 443 sequence clusters, whereas the numbers of individual elements with high support are 94, 56, 64, and 406, respectively. Removing also transposon-associated repeats, finally 78, 53, 42 and 168 sequences, respectively, are left belonging to 109 different clusters in the data set. Experimental analysis of selected ncRNA candidates in Synechocystis PCC6803 validated new ncRNAs originating from the fabF-hoxH and apcC-prmA intergenic spacers and three highly expressed ncRNAs belonging to the Yfr2 family of ncRNAs. Yfr2a promoter-luxAB fusions confirmed a very strong activity of this promoter and indicated a stimulation of expression if the cultures were exposed to elevated light intensities. CONCLUSION: Comparison to entries in Rfam and experimental testing of selected ncRNA candidates in Synechocystis PCC6803 indicate a high reliability of the current prediction, despite some contamination by the high number of repetitive sequences in some of these species. In particular, we identified in the four species altogether 8 new ncRNA homologs belonging to the Yfr2 family of ncRNAs. Modelling of RNA secondary structures indicated two conserved single-stranded sequence motifs that might be involved in RNA-protein interactions or in the recognition of target RNAs. Since our analysis has been restricted to find ncRNA candidates with a reasonable high degree of conservation among these four cyanobacteria, there might be many more, requiring direct experimental approaches for their identification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although technical advances in genomics and proteomics research have yielded a better understanding of the coding capacity of a genome, one major challenge remaining is the identification of all expressed proteins, especially those less than 100 amino acids in length. Such information can be particularly relevant to human pathogens, such as Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, since it will provide further insight into the parasite biology and life cycle.

RESULTS: Starting with 993 T. brucei transcripts, previously shown by RNA-Sequencing not to coincide with annotated coding sequences (CDS), homology searches revealed that 173 predicted short open reading frames in these transcripts are conserved across kinetoplastids with 13 also conserved in representative eukaryotes. Mining mass spectrometry data sets revealed 42 transcripts encoding at least one matching peptide. RNAi-induced down-regulation of these 42 transcripts revealed seven to be essential in insect-form trypanosomes with two also required for the bloodstream life cycle stage. To validate the specificity of the RNAi results, each lethal phenotype was rescued by co-expressing an RNAi-resistant construct of each corresponding CDS. These previously non-annotated essential small proteins localized to a variety of cell compartments, including the cell surface, mitochondria, nucleus and cytoplasm, inferring the diverse biological roles they are likely to play in T. brucei. We also provide evidence that one of these small proteins is required for replicating the kinetoplast (mitochondrial) DNA.

CONCLUSIONS: Our studies highlight the presence and significance of small proteins in a protist and expose potential new targets to block the survival of trypanosomes in the insect vector and/or the mammalian host.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A detailed understanding of an RNA's correct secondary
and tertiary structure is crucial to understanding its function and
mechanism in the cell. Free energy minimization with energy parameters
based on the nearest-neighbor model and comparative analysis are
the primary methods for predicting an RNA's secondary structure from
its sequence. Version 3.1 of Mfold has been available since 1999.
This version contains an expanded sequence dependence of energy parameters
and the ability to incorporate coaxial stacking into free energy
calculations. We test Mfold 3.1 by performing the largest and most
phylogenetically diverse comparison of rRNA and tRNA structures predicted
by comparative analysis and Mfold, and we use the results of our
tests on 16S and 23S rRNA sequences to assess the improvement between
Mfold 2.3 and Mfold 3.1. RESULTS: The average prediction accuracy
for a 16S or 23S rRNA sequence with Mfold 3.1 is 41{\%}, while the prediction
accuracies for the majority of 16S and 23S rRNA structures tested
are between 20{\%} and 60{\%}, with some having less than 20{\%} prediction
accuracy. The average prediction accuracy was 71{\%} for 5S rRNA and
69{\%} for tRNA. The majority of the 5S rRNA and tRNA sequences have
prediction accuracies greater than 60{\%}. The prediction accuracy of
16S rRNA base-pairs decreases exponentially as the number of nucleotides
intervening between the 5' and 3' halves of the base-pair increases.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates that the current set of nearest-neighbor
energy parameters in conjunction with the Mfold folding algorithm
are unable to consistently and reliably predict an RNA's correct
secondary structure. For 16S or 23S rRNA structure prediction, Mfold
3.1 offers little improvement over Mfold 2.3. However, the nearest-neighbor
energy parameters do work well for shorter RNA sequences such as
tRNA or 5S rRNA, or for larger rRNAs when the contact distance between
the base-pairs is less than 100 nucleotides.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

siRNAs prediction tools and for the design methods able to pick up
high silencing potential siRNAs. RESULTS: In this paper, two systems
have been established for the prediction of functional siRNAs: (1)
a statistical model based on sequence information and (2) a machine
learning model based on three features of siRNA sequences, namely
binary description, thermodynamic profile and nucleotide composition.
Both of the two methods show high performance on the two datasets
we have constructed for training the model. CONCLUSION: Both of the
two methods studied in this paper emphasize the importance of sequence

RESULTS: TO IMPROVE THE DESIGN OF EFFICIENT SIRNA MOLECULES, WE PERFORMED
A COMPARATIVE, THERMODYNAMIC AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS ON A HETEROGENEOUS
SET OF 653 SIRNAS COLLECTED FROM THE LITERATURE. WE USED THIS TRAINING
SET TO SELECT SIRNA FEATURES AND OPTIMIZE COMPUTATIONAL MODELS. WE
IDENTIFIED 18 PARAMETERS THAT CORRELATE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH SILENCING

WE DERIVED AN SIRNA POSITION-DEPENDENT CONSENSUS, AND OPTIMIZED THE

RESULTS: We have developed MicroTar, an animal miRNA target prediction tool based on miRNA-target complementarity and thermodynamic data. The algorithm uses predicted free energies of unbound mRNA and putative mRNA-miRNA heterodimers, implicitly addressing the accessibility of the mRNA 3' untranslated region. MicroTar does not rely on evolutionary conservation to discern functional targets, and is able to predict both conserved and non-conserved targets. MicroTar source code and predictions are accessible at http://tiger.dbs.nus.edu.sg/microtar/, where both serial and parallel versions of the program can be downloaded under an open-source licence.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many types of analyses, data about gene structure and locations of non-coding regions of genes are required. Although a vast amount of genomic sequence data is available, precise annotation of genes is lacking behind. Finding the corresponding gene of a given protein sequence by means of conventional tools is error prone, and cannot be completed without manual inspection, which is time consuming and requires considerable experience. RESULTS: Scipio is a tool based on the alignment program BLAT to determine the precise gene structure given a protein sequence and a genome sequence. It identifies intron-exon borders and splice sites and is able to cope with sequencing errors and genes spanning several contigs in genomes that have not yet been assembled to supercontigs or chromosomes. Instead of producing a set of hits with varying confidence, Scipio gives the user a coherent summary of locations on the genome that code for the query protein. The output contains information about discrepancies that may result from sequencing errors. Scipio has also successfully been used to find homologous genes in closely related species. Scipio was tested with 979 protein queries against 16 arthropod genomes (intra species search). For cross-species annotation, Scipio was used to annotate 40 genes from Homo sapiens in the primates Pongo pygmaeus abelii and Callithrix jacchus. The prediction quality of Scipio was tested in a comparative study against that of BLAT and the well established program Exonerate. CONCLUSION: Scipio is able to precisely map a protein query onto a genome. Even in cases when there are many sequencing errors, or when incomplete genome assemblies lead to hits that stretch across multiple target sequences, it very often provides the user with the correct determination of intron-exon borders and splice sites, showing an improved prediction accuracy compared to BLAT and Exonerate. Apart from being able to find genes in the genome that encode the query protein, Scipio can also be used to annotate genes in closely related species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing availability of fungal genome sequences provides large numbers of proteins for evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses. However the heterogeneity of data, including the quality of genome annotation and the difficulty of retrieving true orthologs, makes such investigations challenging. The aim of this study was to provide a reliable and integrated resource of orthologous gene families to perform comparative and phylogenetic analyses in fungi. DESCRIPTION: FUNYBASE is a database dedicated to the analysis of fungal single-copy genes extracted from available fungal genomes sequences, their classification into reliable clusters of orthologs, and the assessment of their informative value for phylogenetic reconstruction based on amino acid sequences. The current release of FUNYBASE contains two types of protein data: (i) a complete set of protein sequences extracted from 30 public fungal genomes and classified into clusters of orthologs using a robust automated procedure, and (ii) a subset of 246 reliable ortholog clusters present as single copy genes in 21 fungal genomes. For each of these 246 ortholog clusters, phylogenetic trees were reconstructed based on their amino acid sequences. To assess the informative value of each ortholog cluster, each was compared to a reference species tree constructed using a concatenation of roughly half of the 246 sequences that are best approximated by the WAG evolutionary model. The orthologs were classified according to a topological score, which measures their ability to recover the same topology as the reference species tree. The full results of these analyses are available on-line with a user-friendly interface that allows for searches to be performed by species name, the ortholog cluster, various keywords, or using the BLAST algorithm. Examples of fruitful utilization of FUNYBASE for investigation of fungal phylogenetics are also presented. CONCLUSION: FUNYBASE constitutes a novel and useful resource for two types of analyses: (i) comparative studies can be greatly facilitated by reliable clusters of orthologs across sets of user-defined fungal genomes, and (ii) phylogenetic reconstruction can be improved by identifying genes with the highest informative value at the desired taxonomic level.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several eukaryotic proteins associated to the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane carry a Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is linked to the C-terminal residue after a proteolytic cleavage occurring at the so called omega-site. Computational methods were developed to discriminate proteins that undergo this post-translational modification starting from their aminoacidic sequences. However more accurate methods are needed for a reliable annotation of whole proteomes.

RESULTS: Here we present PredGPI, a prediction method that, by coupling a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM), is able to efficiently predict both the presence of the GPI-anchor and the position of the omega-site. PredGPI is trained on a non-redundant dataset of experimentally characterized GPI-anchored proteins whose annotation was carefully checked in the literature.

CONCLUSION: PredGPI outperforms all the other previously described methods and is able to correctly replicate the results of previously published high-throughput experiments. PredGPI reaches a lower rate of false positive predictions with respect to other available methods and it is therefore a costless, rapid and accurate method for screening whole proteomes.},

During each release cycle approximately two weeks are allocated to generate all the genomic alignments and the protein homology predictions. The number of calculations required for this task grows approximately quadratically with the number of species. We currently support 50 species in Ensembl and we expect the number to continue to grow in the future.

RESULTS: We present eHive, a new fault tolerant distributed processing system initially designed to support comparative genomic analysis, based on blackboard systems, network distributed autonomous agents, dataflow graphs and block-branch diagrams. In the eHive system a MySQL database serves as the central blackboard and the autonomous agent, a Perl script, queries the system and runs jobs as required. The system allows us to define dataflow and branching rules to suit all our production pipelines. We describe the implementation of three pipelines: (1) pairwise whole genome alignments, (2) multiple whole genome alignments and (3) gene trees with protein homology inference.

The recent availability of detailed information about transcript structure from high-throughput sequencing of messenger RNA (RNA-Seq) delineates many expressed genes and promises increased accuracy in gene prediction. Computational gene predictors have been intensively developed for and tested in well-studied animal genomes. Hundreds of fungal genomes are now or will soon be sequenced. The differences of fungal genomes from animal genomes and the phylogenetic sparsity of well-studied fungi call for gene-prediction tools tailored to them.

RESULTS: SnowyOwl is a new gene prediction pipeline that uses RNA-Seq data to train and provide hints for the generation of Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based gene predictions and to evaluate the resulting models. The pipeline has been developed and streamlined by comparing its predictions to manually curated gene models in three fungal genomes and validated against the high-quality gene annotation of Neurospora crassa; SnowyOwl predicted N. crassa genes with 83{\%} sensitivity and 65{\%} specificity. SnowyOwl gains sensitivity by repeatedly running the HMM gene predictor Augustus with varied input parameters and selectivity by choosing the models with best homology to known proteins and best agreement with the RNA-Seq data.

CONCLUSIONS: SnowyOwl efficiently uses RNA-Seq data to produce accurate gene models in both well-studied and novel fungal genomes. The source code for the SnowyOwl pipeline (in Python) and a web interface (in PHP) is freely available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/snowyowl/.},

the first stage, the SVM-RFE technique was most efficient and robust
in the presence of low number of samples and high input space dimension.
This method yielded an optimal subset of 14 representative features,
which were all related to energy and sequence motifs. The second
stage evaluated the performance of the predictors (overall correlation
coefficient between observed and predicted efficacy, r; mean error,
ME; and root-mean-square-error, RMSE) using 8-fold and minus-one-RNA
cross-validation methods. The profiled SVM produced the best results
(r = 0.44, ME = 0.022, and RMSE= 0.278) and predicted high ({\textgreater}75{\%}
inhibition of gene expression) and low efficacy ({\textless}25{\%}) AOs with
a success rate of 83.3{\%} and 82.9{\%}, respectively, which is better
than by previous approaches. A web server for AO prediction is available
online at http://aosvm.cgb.ki.se/. CONCLUSIONS: The SVM approach
is well suited to the AO prediction problem, and yields a prediction
accuracy superior to previous methods. The profiled SVM was found
to perform better than the standard SVM, suggesting that it could
lead to improvements in other prediction problems as well.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous paper, we introduced MUSCLE, a new program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing MUSCLE to achieve the highest scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles. RESULTS: We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer. CONCLUSIONS: MUSCLE offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs.

RESULTS: WE DEVELOPED A GENERAL BAYESIAN METHOD FOR THE INFERENCE OF MIRNA TARGET SITES, IN WHICH, FOR EACH MIRNA, WE EXPLICITLY MODEL THE EVOLUTION OF ORTHOLOGOUS TARGET SITES IN A SET OF RELATED SPECIES.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacterial promoters, which increase the efficiency of gene expression, differ from other promoters by several characteristics. This difference, not yet widely exploited in bioinformatics, looks promising for the development of relevant computational tools to search for strong promoters in bacterial genomes. RESULTS: We describe a new triad pattern algorithm that predicts strong promoter candidates in annotated bacterial genomes by matching specific patterns for the group I sigma70 factors of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. It detects promoter-specific motifs by consecutively matching three patterns, consisting of an UP-element, required for interaction with the alpha subunit, and then optimally-separated patterns of -35 and -10 boxes, required for interaction with the sigma70 subunit of RNA polymerase. Analysis of 43 bacterial genomes revealed that the frequency of candidate sequences depends on the A+T content of the DNA under examination. The accuracy of in silico prediction was experimentally validated for the genome of a hyperthermophilic bacterium, Thermotoga maritima, by applying a cell-free expression assay using the predicted strong promoters. In this organism, the strong promoters govern genes for translation, energy metabolism, transport, cell movement, and other as-yet unidentified functions. CONCLUSION: The triad pattern algorithm developed for predicting strong bacterial promoters is well suited for analyzing bacterial genomes with an A+T content of less than 62{\%}. This computational tool opens new prospects for investigating global gene expression, and individual strong promoters in bacteria of medical and/or economic significance.},

abstract = {Background: In bacteria, sigma factors and other transcriptional regulatory proteins recognize DNA patterns upstream of their target genes and interact with RNA polymerase to control transcription. As a consequence of evolution, DNA sequences recognized by transcription factors are thought to be enriched in intergenic regions (IRs) and depleted from coding regions of prokaryotic genomes. Results: In this work, we report that genomic distribution of transcription factors binding sites is biased towards IRs, and that this bias is conserved amongst bacterial species. We further take advantage of this observation to develop an algorithm that can efficiently identify promoter boxes by a distribution-dependent approach rather than a direct sequence comparison approach. This strategy, which can easily be combined with other methodologies, allowed the identification of promoter sequences in ten species and can be used with any annotated bacterial genome, with results that rival with current methodologies. Experimental validations of predicted promoters also support our approach. Conclusion: Considering that complete genomic sequences of over 1000 bacteria will soon be available and that little transcriptional information is available for most of them, our algorithm constitutes a promising tool for the prediction of promoter sequences. Importantly, our methodology could also be adapted to identify DNA sequences recognized by other regulatory proteins.},

@article{Makita2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computational prediction methods are currently used to identify genes in prokaryote genomes. However, identification of the correct translation initiation sites remains a difficult task. Accurate translation initiation sites (TISs) are important not only for the annotation of unknown proteins but also for the prediction of operons, promoters, and small non-coding RNA genes, as this typically makes use of the intergenic distance. A further problem is that most existing methods are optimized for Escherichia coli data sets; applying these methods to newly sequenced bacterial genomes may not result in an equivalent level of accuracy. RESULTS: Based on a biological representation of the translation process, we applied Bayesian statistics to create a score function for predicting translation initiation sites. In contrast to existing programs, our combination of methods uses supervised learning to optimally use the set of known translation initiation sites. We combined the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) sequence, the distance between the translation initiation site and the RBS sequence, the base composition of the start codon, the nucleotide composition (A-rich sequences) following start codons, and the expected distribution of the protein length in a Bayesian scoring function. To further increase the prediction accuracy, we also took into account the operon orientation. The outcome of the procedure achieved a prediction accuracy of 93.2{\%} in 858 E. coli genes from the EcoGene data set and 92.7{\%} accuracy in a data set of 1243 Bacillus subtilis 'non-y' genes. We confirmed the performance in the GC-rich Gamma-Proteobacteria Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243. CONCLUSION: Hon-yaku, being based on a careful choice of elements important in translation, improved the prediction accuracy in B. subtilis data sets and other bacteria except for E. coli. We believe that most remaining mispredictions are due to atypical ribosomal binding sequences used in specific translation control processes, or likely errors in the training data sets.},

@article{Das2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression is a major challenge in biology. An important task in this challenge is to identify regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short DNA segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence availability and in high-throughput gene expression analysis technologies have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in DNA motif finding algorithms. RESULTS: Earlier algorithms use promoter sequences of coregulated genes from single genome and search for statistically overrepresented motifs. Recent algorithms are designed to use phylogenetic footprinting or orthologous sequences and also an integrated approach where promoter sequences of coregulated genes and phylogenetic footprinting are used. All the algorithms studied have been reported to correctly detect the motifs that have been previously detected by laboratory experimental approaches, and some algorithms were able to find novel motifs. However, most of these motif finding algorithms have been shown to work successfully in yeast and other lower organisms, but perform significantly worse in higher organisms. CONCLUSION: Despite considerable efforts to date, DNA motif finding remains a complex challenge for biologists and computer scientists. Researchers have taken many different approaches in developing motif discovery tools and the progress made in this area of research is very encouraging. Performance comparison of different motif finding tools and identification of the best tools have proven to be a difficult task because tools are designed based on algorithms and motif models that are diverse and complex and our incomplete understanding of the biology of regulatory mechanism does not always provide adequate evaluation of underlying algorithms over motif models.},

Tryptophan has been previously reported to be a limiting amino acid during Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth at low temperature. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of the tryptophan metabolism on growth and fermentation performance during low-temperature wine fermentation. To this end, we constructed the deletion mutants of the TRP1 and TAT2 genes in a derivative haploid of a commercial wine strain, and the TAT2 gene was overexpressed in the prototroph and auxotroph ($\Delta$trp1) backgrounds. Then we characterized growth and fermentation activity during wine fermentation at low and optimum temperatures. Our results partially support the role of this amino acid in cold yeast growth. Although deletion of TRP1 impaired amino acid uptake and the growth rate at low temperature in synthetic must, this growth impairment did not affect the fermentation rate. Deletion of TAT2 endorsed this strain with the highest nitrogen consumption capacity and the greatest fermentation activity at low temperature. Our results also evidenced reduced ammonium consumption in all the strains at low temperature. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol. Prog., 30:776-783, 2014.},

The CRISPR/Cas system consists of two components: a single Cas9 nuclease and a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). Therefore, the system for constructing RGNs is simple and efficient, but the utilization of RGNs in filamentous fungi has not been validated. In this study, we established the CRISPR/Cas system in the model filamentous fungus, Pyricularia oryzae, using Cas9 that was codon-optimized for filamentous fungi, and the endogenous RNA polymerase (RNAP) III U6 promoter and a RNAP II fungal promoter for the expression of the sgRNA. We further demonstrated that RGNs could recognize the desired sequences and edit endogenous genes through homologous recombination-mediated targeted gene replacement with high efficiency.

Statistical properties of these elements are computed for small RNA molecules of chain lengths up to 100. The results of RNA structure statistics depend strongly on the particular alphabet chosen. The statistical reference is compared with the data derived from natural RNA molecules with similar base frequencies. Secondary structures are represented as trees. Tree editing provides a quantitative measure for the distance dt, between two structures. We compute a structure density surface as the conditional probability of two structures having distance t given that their sequences have distance h. This surface indicates that the vast majority of possible minimum free energy secondary structures occur within a fairly small neighborhood of any typical (random) sequence. Correlation lengths for secondary structures in their tree representations are computed from probability densities. They are appropriate measures for the complexity of the sequence-structure relation. The correlation length also provides a quantitative estimate for the mean sensitivity of structures to point mutations.},

describe self-folding together with the hybridization between a pair
of finite length DNA or RNA molecules. The model takes into account
the entire ensemble of single- and double-stranded species in solution
and their mole fractions at different temperatures. The folding and
hybridization models deal with matched pairs, mismatches, symmetric
and asymmetric interior loops, bulges, and single-base stacking that
might exist at duplex ends or at the ends of helices. All possible
conformations of the single- and double-stranded species are explored.
Only intermolecular basepairs are considered in duplexes at this
stage.In particular we focus on the role of stacking between neighboring
nucleotide residues of single unfolded strands as an important source
of enthalpy change on helix formation which has not been modeled
computationally thus far. Changes in the states of the single strands
with temperature are shown to lead to a larger heat effect at higher
temperature. An important consequence of this is that predictions
of enthalpies, which are based on databases of nearest-neighbor energy
parameters determined for molecules or duplexes with lower melting
temperatures compared with the melting temperatures of the oligos
for which they are used as a predictive tool, will be underestimated.},

abstract = {The rates of cis to trans interconversion of Glt-(Ala)n-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilides (n = 1-3) were estimated by means of a two-step process with chymotrypsin as the trans-substrate cleaving activity. By the aid of this system, pig kidney and several other tissues contained demonstrable catalytic activity against the cis to trans interconversion of the proline containing peptides. The active protein fraction was purified 38-fold from pig kidney cortex by ammonium sulfate precipitation and a series of column chromatographic techniques. Activity was detected against the cis to trans interconversion of Glt-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide to a different extent. No activity was found with Phe-Pro-4-nitroanilide. With respect to the substrate specificity, this enzyme must be classified as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase. The enzyme was strongly inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzoate, sodium dodecylsulfate, Hg2+- and Cu2+-ions, but was not inhibited by metal chelators, diisopropylphosphorofluoridate and chlorotosylamidophenylbutane. The activity is abolished by incubation with trypsin. The enzyme is heat sensitive at 50 degrees C. The results presented in this paper suggest a new type of enzymes, characterized by catalytic activity against conformational interconversions. The possibility of the location of the enzyme on ribosomal particles is discussed.},

Nuclear ribosomal 18S gene sequences were used together with the most similar published and unpublished sequences of fungi from other sources, to reconstruct an ML tree.

At the edge of life, epilithic lichens withdraw inside the airspaces of rocks to find conditions still compatible with life; this study provides evidence, for the first time, that the same microbes associated to epilithic thalli also have the same fate and chose endolithic life. These results support the concept of lichens being complex symbiotic systems, which offer attractive and sheltered habitats for other microbes.},

In bacteria, a few regulatory RNA molecules have long been known, but the extent of their role in the cell was not fully appreciated until the recent discovery of hundreds of potential sRNA genes in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Orthologs of these E. coli sRNA genes, as well as unrelated sRNAs, were also found in other bacteria. Here we review the disparate experimental approaches used over the years to identify sRNA molecules and their genes in prokaryotes. These include genome-wide searches based on the biocomputational prediction of non-coding RNA genes, global detection of non-coding transcripts using microarrays, and shotgun cloning of small RNAs (RNomics). Other sRNAs were found by either co-purification with RNA-binding proteins, such as Hfq or CsrA/RsmA, or classical cloning of abundant small RNAs after size fractionation in polyacrylamide gels. In addition, bacterial genetics offers powerful tools that aid in the search for sRNAs that may play a critical role in the regulatory circuit of interest, for example, the response to stress or the adaptation to a change in nutrient availability. Many of the techniques discussed here have also been successfully applied to the discovery of eukaryotic and archaeal sRNAs.},

Recently, O(N(6)) time and O(N(4)) space dynamic programming (DP) algorithms have become available that compute the partition function of RNA-RNA interaction complexes, thereby providing detailed insights into their thermodynamic properties. RESULTS: Modifications to the grammars underlying earlier approaches enables the calculation of interaction probabilities for any given interval on the target RNA. The computation of the 'hybrid probabilities' is complemented by a stochastic sampling algorithm that produces a Boltzmann weighted ensemble of RNA-RNA interaction structures. The sampling of k structures requires only negligible additional memory resources and runs in O(k.N(3)). AVAILABILITY: The algorithms described here are implemented in C as part of the rip package.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Bacterial small ribonucleic acids (sRNAs) that are not ribosomal and transfer or messenger RNAs were initially identified in the sixties, whereas their molecular functions are still under active investigation today. It is now widely accepted that most play central roles in gene expression regulation in response to environmental changes. Interestingly, some are also implicated in bacterial virulence. Functional studies revealed that a large subset of these sRNAs act by an antisense mechanism thanks to pairing interactions with dedicated mRNA targets, usually around their translation start sites, to modulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Some sRNAs modulate protein activity or mimic the structure of other macromolecules. In the last few years, in silico methods have been developed to detect more bacterial sRNAs. Among these, computational analyses of the bacterial genomes by comparative genomics have predicted the existence of a plethora of sRNAs, some that were confirmed to be expressed in vivo. The prediction accuracy of these computational tools is highly variable and can be perfectible. Here we review the computational studies that have contributed to detecting the sRNA gene and mRNA targets in bacteria and the methods for their experimental testing. In addition, the remaining challenges are discussed.},

@article{Suzek2001,
abstract = {As the pace of genome sequencing has accelerated, the need for highly accurate gene prediction systems has grown. Computational systems for identifying genes in prokaryotic genomes have sensitivities of 98-99{\%} or higher (Delcher et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 27, 4636-4641, 1999). These accuracy figures are calculated by comparing the locations of verified stop codons to the predictions. Determining the accuracy of start codon prediction is more problematic, however, due to the relatively small number of start sites that have been confirmed by independent, non-computational methods. Nonetheless, the accuracy of gene finders at predicting the exact gene boundaries at both the 5' and 3' ends of genes is of critical importance for microbial genome annotation, especially in light of the important signaling information that is sometimes found on the 5' end of a protein coding region. In this paper we propose a probabilistic method to improve the accuracy of gene identification systems at finding precise translation start sites. The new system, RBSfinder, is tested on a validated set of genes from Escherichia coli, for which it improves the accuracy of start site locations predicted by computational gene finding systems from the range 67-77{\%} to 90{\%} correct.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Messenger RNA expression is important in normal development and differentiation, as well as in manifestation of disease. RNA-seq experiments allow for the identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes and their corresponding isoforms on a genome-wide scale. However, statistical methods are required to ensure that accurate identifications are made. A number of methods exist for identifying DE genes, but far fewer are available for identifying DE isoforms. When isoform DE is of interest, investigators often apply gene-level (count-based) methods directly to estimates of isoform counts. Doing so is not recommended. In short, estimating isoform expression is relatively straightforward for some groups of isoforms, but more challenging for others. This results in estimation uncertainty that varies across isoform groups. Count-based methods were not designed to accommodate this varying uncertainty, and consequently, application of them for isoform inference results in reduced power for some classes of isoforms and increased false discoveries for others.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Taking advantage of the merits of empirical Bayesian methods, we have developed EBSeq for identifying DE isoforms in an RNA-seq experiment comparing two or more biological conditions.

sequences with maximum target-specificity for mammalian RNA interference
(RNAi) is one of the hottest topics in molecular biology. The relationship
between siRNA sequences and RNAi activity has been studied extensively
to establish rules for selecting highly effective sequences. However,
there is a pressing need to compute siRNA sequences that minimize
off-target silencing effects efficiently and to match any non-targeted
sequences with mismatches. RESULTS: The enumeration of potential
cross-hybridization candidates is non-trivial, because siRNA sequences
are short, ca. 19 nt in length, and at least three mismatches with
non-targets are required. With at least three mismatches, there are
typically four or five contiguous matches, so that a BLAST search
frequently overlooks off-target candidates. By contrast, existing
accurate approaches are expensive to execute; thus we need to develop
an accurate, efficient algorithm that uses seed hashing, the pigeonhole
principle, and combinatorics to identify mismatch patterns. Tests
show that our method can list potential cross-hybridization candidates

traditional methods by orders of magnitude in terms of computational

abstract = {Motivation: Automatic error correction of high-throughput sequencing data can have a dramatic impact on the amount of usable base pairs and their quality. It has been shown that the performance of tasks such as de novo genome assembly and SNP calling can be dramatically improved after read error correction. While a large number of methods specialized for correcting substitution errors as found in Illumina data exist, few methods for the correction of indel errors, common to technologies like 454 or Ion Torrent, have been proposed. Results: We present Fiona, a new stand-alone read error-correction method. Fiona provides a new statistical approach for sequencing error detection and optimal error correction and estimates its parameters automatically. Fiona is able to correct substitution, insertion and deletion errors and can be applied to any sequencing technology. It uses an efficient implementation of the partial suffix array to detect read overlaps with different seed lengths in parallel. We tested Fiona on several real datasets from a variety of organisms with different read lengths and compared its performance with state-of-the-art methods. Fiona shows a constantly higher correction accuracy over a broad range of datasets from 454 and Ion Torrent sequencers, without compromise in speed. Conclusion: Fiona is an accurate parameter-free read error-correction method that can be run on inexpensive hardware and can make use of multicore parallelization whenever available. Fiona was implemented using the SeqAn library for sequence analysis and is publicly available for download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/fiona.

studying gene function and regulatory networks. Due to the problem
of potential cross hybridization, using full-length genes for microarray
construction is not appropriate in some situations. A bioinformatic
tool, PRIMEGENS, has recently been developed for the automatic design
of PCR primers using DNA fragments that are specific to individual
open reading frames (ORFs). RESULTS: PRIMEGENS first carries out
a BLAST search for each target ORF against all other ORFs of the
genome to quickly identify possible homologous sequences. Then it
performs optimal sequence alignment between the target ORF and each
of its homologous ORFs using dynamic programming. PRIMEGENS uses
the sequence alignments to select gene- specific fragments, and then
feeds the fragments to the Primer3 program to design primer pairs
for PCR amplification. PRIMEGENS can be run from the command line
on Unix/Linux platforms as a stand-alone package or it can be used
from a Web interface. The program runs efficiently, and it takes
a few seconds per sequence on a typical workstation. PCR primers
specific to individual ORFs from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and Deinococcus
radiodurans R1 have been designed. The PCR amplification results
indicate that this method is very efficient and reliable for designing

all probes on the array must hybridize to their intended targets
under the same reaction conditions, most importantly at the temperature
T at which the experiment is conducted. RESULTS: We present an efficient
algorithm for the probe design problem. Melting temperatures are
calculated for all possible probe-target interactions using an extended

a combination of suffix trees and dynamic programming based alignment

properties, propensity to form internal hairpins, etc.) is implemented
and moreover, specificity is achieved by a conceptually new method.
After selecting possible siRNA candidates with the optimal functional
properties, putative unspecific matches, which can cause cross-hybridization,
are checked in databases containing a unique entry for each gene.
These truly non-redundant databases are constructed from the genome
annotations (Ensembl). Also intron/exon boundaries, presence of polymorphisms
(single nucleotide polymorphisms) specificity for either gene or
transcript, and other features can be selected to be considered in
the design of siRNAs. AVAILABILITY: The program is available as a

abstract = {Heterochronic genes control the timing of developmental programs.
In C. elegans, two key genes in the heterochronic pathway, lin-4
and let-7, encode small temporally expressed RNAs (stRNAs) that are
not translated into protein. These stRNAs exert negative post-transcriptional
regulation by binding to complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated
regions of their target genes. stRNAs are transcribed as longer precursor
RNAs that are processed by the RNase Dicer/DCR-1 and members of the
RDE-1/AGO1 family of proteins, which are better known for their roles
in RNA interference (RNAi). However, stRNA function appears unrelated
to RNAi. Both sequence and temporal regulation of let-7 stRNA is
conserved in other animal species suggesting that this is an evolutionarily
ancient gene. Indeed, C. elegans, Drosophila and humans encode at
least 86 other RNAs with similar structural features to lin-4 and
let-7. We postulate that other small non-coding RNAs may function
as stRNAs to control temporal identity during development in C. elegans
and other organisms.},

White rot fungi (WRF) are versatile and robust organisms having enormous potential for oxidative bioremediation of a variety of toxic chemical pollutants due to high tolerance to toxic substances in the environment. WRF are capable of mineralizing a wide variety of toxic xenobiotics due to non-specific nature of their extracellular lignin mineralizing enzymes (LMEs). In recent years, a lot of work has been done on the development and optimization of bioremediation processes using WRF, with emphasis on the study of their enzyme systems involved in biodegradation of industrial pollutants. Many new strains have been identified and their LMEs isolated, purified and characterized. In this review, we have tried to cover the latest developments on enzyme systems of WRF, their low molecular mass mediators and their potential use for bioremediation of industrial pollutants.},

abstract = {The biodegradation of a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, (BTEX) and methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was studied in soil microcosms. Soil inoculation with the toluene-metabolising fungus Cladophialophora sp. strain T1 was evaluated in sterile and non-sterile soil. Induction of biodegradation capacity following BTEX addition was faster in the soil native microflora than in axenic soil cultures of the fungus. Toluene, ethylbenzenes, and the xylenes were metabolized by the fungus but biodegradation of benzene required the activity of the indigenous soil microorganisms. MTBE was not biodegraded under the tested environmental conditions. Biodegradation profiles were also examined under two pH conditions after a long term exposure to BTEX. At neutral conditions the presence of the fungus had little effect on the intrinsic soil biodegradation capacity. At an acidic pH, however, the activity of the indigenous degraders was inhibited and the presence of Cladophialophora sp. increased significantly the biodegradation rates of toluene and ethylbenzene. Comparison of the BTEX biodegradation rates measured in soil batches combining presence and absence of indigenous degraders and the fungal inoculum indicated that no severe antagonism occurred between the indigenous bacteria and Cladophialophora sp. The presence of the fungal inoculum at the end of the experiments was confirmed by PCR-TGGE analysis of small subunits of 18S rDNA.},

Although hot water is used more frequently in bathrooms than in sinks, the fungal counts at 37 degrees C were similar for bathrooms and sinks. Five species of fungus that can grow at 37 degrees C and were found to grow prolifically in bathrooms were identified using DNA and morphological analysis. In both bathrooms and sinks, Exophiala dermatitidis was predominant in culture at 37 degrees C. Moreover, E. dermatitidis grew at 40 degrees C and used surfactant as a nutrient.

The activity of the enzyme was assayed with Glt-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide. The catalytic activity of the isomerase against unfolded ribonuclease is suppressed after preincubation of the enzyme with 0.001 mol . l-1 Cu2+, 0.01 mol . l-1 H+ and by heat inactivation.

Cells maintained at the permissive (35°C) temperature show a high arginine-incorporating activity in ribosome free extracts compared to that found in extracts of cells grown at the non-permissive (40°C) temperature. Temperature shift experiments as well as studies with cells transformed by wild type Rous sarcoma virus suggest that the decreased activity in cells grown at 40°C is not due to a high temperature per se. The lower arginine incorporation in the 40°C cell extracts is partially due to a decrease in the activity of arginyl transferase which catalyses the transfer of arginine from arginyl tRNA to the acceptor protein. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the radioactive product shows that the acceptor molecules present in extracts of cells grown at 40°C are larger and qualitatively different from those found in extracts of cells grown at 35°C.},

the difference in affinity is due to the target structure, both the
secondary structure of the stem and the structure in the loop. Measurement
of the bimolecular association rate constant, k1, and the dissociation

abstract = {Substrate specificities, as reflected in kc/Km, were determined for the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activities of cyclophilin and the FK-506 binding protein (FKBP). The substrates investigated were peptides of the general structure Suc-Ala-Xaa-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, where Xaa = Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Phe, His, Lys, on Glu. While kc/Km for cyclophilin-catalyzed isomerization shows little dependence on Xaa, kc/Km values for FKBP-catalyzed isomerization display a marked dependence on Xaa and vary over 3 orders of magnitude. An important outcome of this work is the discovery that Suc-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-pNA is a reactive substrate for FKBP (kc/Km = 640,000 M-1 s-1). This substrate can be used with FKBP concentrations that are low enough to allow, for the first time, accurate determinations of Ki values for tight-binding inhibitors of FKBP. Using this new assay, we found that FK-506 inhibits FKBP with Ki = 1.7 +/- 0.6 nM. The results of this work support the hypothesis that cyclophilin and FKBP are members of a family of peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases and that the members of this family possess distinct substrate specificities that allow them to play diverse physiologic roles.},

To determine the nearest-neighbor parameters, thermodynamics for 68 different hybrid sequences (136 single-stranded oligonucleotides) with 5-13 nucleotide length including several duplexes with identical nearest-neighbors were measured by UV melting procedure. These sequences were selected to have many different combinations of nearest-neighbor pairs, and so that the number of the 16 nearest-neighbor sequences in the oligomers were as equal as possible. The structures of the hybrids were also investigated by measuring circular dichroism spectra. Comparing delta G degree 37 values of the hybrids with DNA/DNA and RNA/RNA parameters reported previously (Breslauer, K.J., Frank, R., Bl cker, H., {\&} Marky, L.A. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

abstract = {Thermodynamic measurements are reported for 51 DNA duplexes with A.A, C.C, G.G, and T.T single mismatches in all possible Watson-Crick contexts. These measurements were used to test the applicability of the nearest-neighbor model and to calculate the 16 unique nearest-neighbor parameters for the 4 single like with like base mismatches next to a Watson-Crick pair. The observed trend in stabilities of mismatches at 37 degrees C is G.G {\textgreater} T.T approximately A.A {\textgreater} C.C. The observed stability trend for the closing Watson-Crick pair on the 5' side of the mismatch is G.C {\textgreater}/= C.G {\textgreater}/= A.T {\textgreater}/= T.A. The mismatch contribution to duplex stability ranges from -2.22 kcal/mol for GGC.GGC to +2.66 kcal/mol for ACT.ACT. The mismatch nearest-neighbor parameters predict the measured thermodynamics with average deviations of DeltaG degrees 37 = 3.3{\%}, DeltaH degrees = 7. 4{\%}, DeltaS degrees = 8.1{\%}, and TM = 1.1 degrees C. The imino proton region of 1-D NMR spectra shows that G.G and T.T mismatches form hydrogen-bonded structures that vary depending on the Watson-Crick context. The data reported here combined with our previous work provide for the first time a complete set of thermodynamic parameters for molecular recognition of DNA by DNA with or without single internal mismatches. The results are useful for primer design and understanding the mechanism of triplet repeat diseases.},

This phosphoinositide is abundant at the TGN and acts to recruit components required for carrier formation to the membrane. Other phosphoinositides are also present on the TGN, but the extent to which they regulate trafficking is less clear. Further characterization of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases together with identification of new TGN-associated phosphoinositide-binding proteins will reveal the extent to which different phosphoinositides regulate TGN trafficking, and help define the molecular mechanisms involved.},

The corresponding microsomal enzyme needed NADPH and O2 to oxidize toluene and glycerol, EDTA, DTT, and PMSF for stabilization. TOMO activity was maximal at 35°C and pH 7.5 and was inhibited by carbon monoxide, Metyrapone, and cytochrome c. TOMO preferred as substrates also other aromatic hydrocarbons with a short aliphatic side chain. Its reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum showed a maximum at 451nm. A substrate-induced Type I spectrum was observed on addition of toluene. These results indicated that TOMO is a cytochrome P450.

Although RNAi has become one of the most powerful tools in molecular biology to assess gene function, there remains a great number of ineffective siRNAs. It is already known that the assembly and activation of RISC is a crucial determinant of RNAi activity, but downstream effects such as target accessibility have not been analysed extensively. Therefore we assessed the effect of target site accessibility and found that it significantly improves the potency of siRNAs. Similarly, miRNAs (microRNAs) act by repressing protein synthesis through imperfect base-pairing to the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of target mRNAs. We found that predicted target sites reside in regions of high accessibility and tested whether this criterion could be used in the search of functional miRNA targets. In addition, we performed reporter gene assays to test whether accessibility correlates with measured mRNA suppression levels. The results of our initial study suggest that secondary structures might add a so far underrepresented layer of complexity in the recognition of RNA targets by miRNAs.},

this structural factor can be characterized by a single parameter
called the hydrogen bond (H-b) index, which represents the average
number of hydrogen bonds formed between nucleotides in the target
region and the rest of the mRNA. This index can be determined using
a computational approach. We tested the correlation between the H-b
index and the gene-silencing effects on three genes (Bcl-2, hTF,

Bacteria must be able to respond in different ways to different stresses and thus require unique regulatory solutions for the physiological challenges they encounter. Recent data indicate that bacteria commonly employ a variety of posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms to coordinate expression of their genes. In many instances, RNA structures embedded at the 5' ends of mRNAs are utilized to sense particular metabolic cues and regulate the encoded genes. These RNA elements are likely to range in structural sophistication, from short sequences recognized by RNA-binding proteins to complex shapes that fold into high-affinity receptors for small organic molecules. Enough examples of RNA-mediated genetic strategies have been found that it is becoming useful to view this overall mode of regulatory control at a genomic level. Eventually, a complete picture of bacterial gene regulation within a single bacterium, from control at transcription initiation to control of mRNA stability, will emerge. But for now, this article seeks to provide a brief overview of the known categories of RNA-mediated genetic mechanisms within the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, with the expectation that it is representative of bacteria as a whole.},

We categorized the Archaea into three general groups to describe what is known about their protein adaptations: thermophilic, psychrophilic, and halophilic. Thermophilic proteins tend to have a prominent hydrophobic core and increased electrostatic interactions to maintain activity at high temperatures. Psychrophilic proteins have a reduced hydrophobic core and a less charged protein surface to maintain flexibility and activity under cold temperatures. Halophilic proteins are characterized by increased negative surface charge due to increased acidic amino acid content and peptide insertions, which compensates for the extreme ionic conditions. While acidophiles, alkaliphiles, and piezophiles are their own class of Archaea, their protein adaptations toward pH and pressure are less discernible. By understanding the protein adaptations used by archaeal extremophiles, we hope to be able to engineer and utilize proteins for industrial, environmental, and biotechnological applications where function in extreme conditions is required for activity.},

one normal healthy control. RESULTS: We identified 61 and 107 genes
respectively induced and repressed by aspirin treatment in the PBMCs
derived from the normal control. In the patient showing aspirin-induced
asthma responses, 31 genes were up-regulated and 6 were down-regulated
after aspirin treatment. Among these,1 gene was expressed with the
same pattern in the control and the patient. In contrast, 19 genes
showed different expression patterns, and it turned out that most
of them were involved in immune responses, cell growth/proliferation,
transcription/translation, and signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These
results show the molecules involved in hypersensitivity to aspirin
and may lead to a better understanding of adverse responses to aspirin.
Furthermore, they can provide clues for identifying novel therapeutic
and/or preventive molecular targets of the adverse effects of aspirin.},

A number of bioremediation strategies have been developed to treat contaminated wastes and sites. Selecting the most appropriate strategy to treat a specific site can be guided by considering three basic principles: the amenability of the pollutant to biological transformation to less toxic products (biochemistry), the accessibility of the contaminant to microorganisms (bioavailability) and the opportunity for optimization of biological activity (bioactivity). Recent advances in the molecular genetics of biodegradation and studies on enzyme-tailoring and DNA-shuffling are discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Melanin is a unique pigment with myriad functions that is found in all biological kingdoms. It is multifunctional, providing defense against environmental stresses such as ultraviolet (UV) light, oxidizing agents and ionizing radiation. Melanin contributes to the ability of fungi to survive in harsh environments. In addition, it plays a role in fungal pathogenesis. Melanin is an amorphous polymer that is produced by one of two synthetic pathways. Fungi may synthesize melanin from endogenous substrate via a 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) intermediate. Alternatively, some fungi produce melanin from L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa). The detailed chemical structure of melanin is not known. However, microscopic studies show that it has an overall granular structure. In fungi, melanin granules are localized to the cell wall where they are likely cross-linked to polysaccharides. Recent studies suggest the fungal melanin may be synthesized in internal vesicles akin to mammalian melanosomes and transported to the cell wall. Potential applications of melanin take advantage of melanin's radioprotective properties and propensity to bind to a variety of substances.},

abstract = {Extremophilic microorganisms have adopted a variety of ingenious strategies for survival under high or low temperature, extreme pressure, and drastic salt concentrations. A novel application area for extremophiles is the use of "extremolytes," organic osmolytes from extremophilic microorganisms, to protect biological macromolecules and cells from damage by external stresses. In extremophiles, these low molecular weight compounds are accumulated in response to increased extracellular salt concentrations, but also as a response to other environmental changes, e.g., increased temperature. Extremolytes minimize the denaturation of biopolymers that usually occurs under conditions of water stress and are compatible with the intracellular machinery at high ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}1 M) concentrations. The ectoines, as the first extremolytes that are produced in a large scale, have already found application as cell protectants in skin care and as protein-free stabilizers of proteins and cells in life sciences. In addition to ectoines, a range of extremolytes with heterogenous chemical structures like the polyol phosphates di-myoinositol-1,1'-phosphate, cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, and alpha-diglycerol phosphate and the mannose derivatives mannosylglycerate (firoin) and mannosylglyceramide (firoin-A) were characterized and were shown to have protective properties toward proteins and cells. A range of new applications, all based on the adaptation to stress conditions conferred by extremolytes, is in development.},

abstract = {Pretreatment of lignocellulose biomass for biofuel production generates inhibitory compounds that interfere with microbial growth and subsequent fermentation. Remediation of the inhibitors by current physical, chemical, and biological abatement means is economically impractical, and overcoming the inhibitory effects of lignocellulose hydrolysate poses a significant technical challenge for lower-cost cellulosic ethanol production. Development of tolerant ethanologenic yeast strains has demonstrated the potential of in situ detoxification for numerous aldehyde inhibitors derived from lignocellulose biomass pretreatment and conversion. In the last decade, significant progress has been made in understanding mechanisms of yeast tolerance for tolerant strain development. Enriched genetic backgrounds, enhanced expression, interplays, and global integration of many key genes enable yeast tolerance. Reprogrammed pathways support yeast functions to withstand the inhibitor stress, detoxify the toxic compounds, maintain energy and redox balance, and complete active metabolism for ethanol fermentation. Complex gene interactions and regulatory networks as well as co-regulation are well recognized as involved in yeast adaptation and tolerance. This review presents our current knowledge on mechanisms of the inhibitor detoxification based on molecular studies and genomic-based approaches. Our improved understanding of yeast tolerance and in situ detoxification provide insight into phenotype-genotype relationships, dissection of tolerance mechanisms, and strategies for more tolerant strain development for biofuels applications.},

abstract = {Exophiala lecanii-corni is a dimorphic fungus capable of degrading several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including ethylbenzene, which has been classified as a hazardous air pollutant by the Environmental Protection Agency. In contrast to bacterial species, little is known about the mechanisms of fungal degradation of VOCs. The results described herein suggest a potential pathway for ethylbenzene degradation in E. lecanii-corni via styrene, phenylacetate and homogentisate. Consistent with this proposed pathway, a full-length homogentisate-1,2-dioxygenase gene (ElHDO) has been identified, cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of ElHDO consists of a 1,452-bp open reading frame encoding a protein with 484 amino acids. The expression of the gene product increases when grown on ethylbenzene, further suggesting that it could be involved in ethylbenzene degradation and may be responsible for the aromatic ring cleavage reaction. In addition, a 907-bp fragment isolated upstream from this gene shares 78{\%} sequence identity at the amino acid level with the amino acid sequences of two fungal phenylacetate hydroxylase genes. This observation suggests that the genes responsible for ethylbenzene degradation may be clustered. This research constitutes the first step towards a better understanding of ethylbenzene degradation in E. lecanii-corni.},

abstract = {Since some amino acids, polyols and sugars in cells are thought to be osmoprotectants, we expected that several amino acids might also contribute to enhancing freeze tolerance in yeast cells. In fact, proline and charged amino acids such as glutamate, arginine and lysine showed a marked cryoprotective activity nearly equivalent to that of glycerol or trehalose, both known as major cryoprotectants for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To investigate the cryoprotective effect of proline on the freezing stress of yeast, we isolated proline-analogue-resistant mutants derived from a proline-non-utilizing strain of S. cerevisiae. When cultured in liquid minimal medium, many mutants showed a prominent increase, two- to approximately tenfold, in cell viability compared to the parent after freezing in the medium at -20 degrees C for 1 week. Some of the freeze-tolerant mutants were found to accumulate a higher amount of proline, as well as of glutamate and arginine which are involved in proline metabolism. It was also observed that proline-non-utilizer and the freeze-tolerant mutants were able to grow against osmotic stress. These results suggest that the increased flux in the metabolic pathway of specific amino acids such as proline is effective for breeding novel freeze-tolerant yeasts.},

However, investigations of growth behavior and physiology of these bacteria when cultivated with n-alkanes of different chain lengths (C6 to C30) as the substrates are still lacking. Growth rates increased with increasing alkane chain length up to a maximum between C12 and C19, with no evident difference between even- and odd-numbered chain lengths, before decreasing with chain lengths greater than C19. Surface hydrophobicity of alkane-grown cells, assessed by determination of the water contact angles, showed a similar pattern, with maximum values associated with growth rates on alkanes with chain lengths between C11 and C19 and significantly lower values for cells grown on pyruvate. A. borkumensis was found to incorporate and modify the fatty acid intermediates generated by the corresponding n-alkane degradation pathway. Cells grown on distinct n-alkanes proved that A. borkumensis is able to not only incorporate but also modify fatty acid intermediates derived from the alkane degradation pathway. Comparing cells grown on pyruvate with those cultivated on hexadecane in terms of their tolerance toward two groups of toxic organic compounds, chlorophenols and alkanols, representing intensely studied organic compounds, revealed similar tolerances toward chlorophenols, whereas the toxicities of different n-alkanols were significantly reduced when hexadecane was used as a carbon source. As one adaptive mechanism of A. borkumensis to these toxic organic solvents, the activity of cis-trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids was proven. These findings could be verified by a detailed transcriptomic comparison between cultures grown on hexadecane and pyruvate and including solvent stress caused by the addition of 1-octanol as the most toxic intermediate of n-alkane degradation.},

Whole cells were incubated with 2-, 3-, and 4-fluorotoluene, and metabolites were characterized by (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance. Oxidation of fluorotoluene by C. echinulata was initiated either at the aromatic ring, resulting in fluorinated o-cresol, or at the methyl group to form fluorobenzoate. The initial conversion of the fluorotoluenes by toluene-grown fungi occurred only at the side chain and resulted in fluorinated benzoates. The latter compounds were the substrate for the ring hydroxylation and, depending on the fluorine position, were further metabolized up to catecholic intermediates. From the (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance metabolic profiles, we propose that diverse fungi that grow on toluene assimilate toluene by an initial oxidation of the methyl group.},

abstract = {Unsaturated fatty acids play an essential role in the biophysical characteristics of cell membranes and determine the proper function of membrane-attached proteins. Thus, the ability of cells to alter the degree of unsaturation in their membranes is an important factor in cellular acclimatization to environmental conditions. Many eukaryotic organisms can synthesize dienoic fatty acids, but Saccharomyces cerevisiae can introduce only a single double bond at the Delta(9) position. We expressed two sunflower (Helianthus annuus) oleate Delta(12) desaturases encoded by FAD2-1 and FAD2-3 in yeast cells of the wild-type W303-1A strain (trp1) and analyzed their effects on growth and stress tolerance. Production of the heterologous desaturases increased the content of dienoic fatty acids, especially 18:2Delta(9,12), the unsaturation index, and the fluidity of the yeast membrane. The total fatty acid content remained constant, and the level of monounsaturated fatty acids decreased. Growth at 15 degrees C was reduced in the FAD2 strains, probably due to tryptophan auxotrophy, since the trp1 (TRP1) transformants that produced the sunflower desaturases grew as well as the control strain did. Our results suggest that changes in the fluidity of the lipid bilayer affect tryptophan uptake and/or the correct targeting of tryptophan transporters. The expression of the sunflower desaturases, in either Trp(+) or Trp(-) strains, increased NaCl tolerance. Production of dienoic fatty acids increased the tolerance to freezing of wild-type cells preincubated at 30 degrees C or 15 degrees C. Thus, membrane fluidity is an essential determinant of stress resistance in S. cerevisiae, and engineering of membrane lipids has the potential to be a useful tool of increasing the tolerance to freezing in industrial strains.},

The total count (number of CFU per 100 ml) of fungal species and the species diversity within each sample were determined. The identification of mold species was based on morphological and molecular methods. In total, 94 mold species belonging to 30 genera were identified.

Several of the same species as isolated from water may have the potential to cause allergic reactions or disease in humans. Other species are common contaminants of food and beverages, and some may cause unwanted changes in the taste or smell of water. The present results indicate that the mycobiota of water should be considered when the microbiological safety and quality of drinking water are assessed.

abstract = {Approximately 500 species of ascomycetous yeasts, including members of Candida and other anamorphic genera, were analyzed for extent of divergence in the variable D1/D2 domain of large subunit (26S) ribosomal DNA. Divergence in this domain is generally sufficient to resolve individual species, resulting in the prediction that 55 currently recognized taxa are synonyms of earlier described species. Phylogenetic relationships among the ascomycetous yeasts were analyzed from D1/D2 sequence divergence. For comparison, the phylogeny of selected members of the Saccharomyces clade was determined from 18S rDNA sequences. Species relationships were highly concordant between the D1/D2 and 18S trees when branches were statistically well supported.},

abstract = {Eighty-five years strains isolated from different cheeses of Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, and Italy were identified using physiological methods and genotypically using random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) analysis. Good congruence was found between the phenotypic and genotypic data for 39 of the isolates. However, 26 isolates of Geotrichum could only be identified to the species level using the genotypic methods and 7 isolates were correctly identified to the genus level only using phenotypic identification methods. The phenotypic identification did not agree with the genotypic data for 14 yeast isolates. Using ubiquinone analysis, yeast cell wall sugars and the diazonium blue B test 5 incorrectly identified isolates with phenotypic methods could be identified genotypically. In addition the 7 isolates identified only to the genus level by the phenotypic methods and the 26 Geotrichum strains were identified to the species level using the polyphasic molecular approach mentioned above. Eleven strains remained unidentified. The 76 identified yeast isolates were assigned to 39 species, the most frequent assignments were made to Debaryomyces hansenii, Geotrichum candidum, Issatchenkia orientalis, Kluyveromyces lactis, K. marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Candida catenulata. It is proposed that Debaryomyces hansenii (Zopf) Lodder et Kregervan Rij and Debaryomyces fabryi Ota should be reinstated. The RAPD-PCR data reinforced the view that the species Galactomyces geotrichum is heterogeneous with all of the Geotrichum isolates from cheese products being assigned G. geotrichum group A sensu M.T. Smith. It is suggested that the name Geotrichum candidum be conserved for this rather common species.},

abstract = {Fungus-growing ants of the genus Atta are known for their leaf-cutting habit, a lifestyle they have maintained since their 50-million-year-old co-evolution with a mutualistic fungus, cultivated as food. Recent studies have highlighted that, in addition to the mutualistic fungus, nests of ants harbor a great diversity of microbial communities. Such microorganisms include the dematiaceous fungi, which are characterized by their melanized cell walls. In order to contribute to the knowledge of fungal ecology, as well as opportunistic strains that may be dispersed by these social insects, we isolated and identified fungi carried by gynes of Atta capiguara and Atta laevigata, collected from colonies located in Fazenda Santana, Botucatu (S{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\~{a}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}o Paulo, Brazil). The isolation was carried out using the oil flotation technique, which is suitable for the growth of black fungi. Inoculated plates were incubated at 25 and 35 °C until black cultures were visible (20-45 days). Isolates were identified based on microscopic and molecular characteristics. Some isolated genera were: Cladophialophora, Cladosporium, Exophiala, Ochroconis, Phaeococcomyces, Phialophora and Penidiella. Hyaline species were also found. The results obtained from this work showed that leaf-cutting gynes may contribute to the dispersal of opportunistic dematiaceous fungi. It is suggested that more attention should be paid to this still unexplored subject.},

abstract = {Black meristematic fungi together with lichens and cyanobacteria dominate the micro-flora of rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments of hot and cold deserts. This study shows that rock inhabiting meristematic fungi are extremely tolerant against high temperatures, desiccation and osmotic stress. Their temperature tolerance increases with increasing dehydration of the fungal thallus. Air dried mycelia of black yeasts stand temperatures up to 120 degrees C for at least 0.5 hours. As response to high temperatures multilayered cell walls are developed and trehalose is accumulated whereas the intracellular glycerol regulates the osmotic potential under NaCl stress. Strains from rock in moderate climate (North Germany) show the same tolerance than those isolated from the Mediterranean area. Hortaea werneckii--hitherto only described as agent of human Tinea nigra--is shown to be the most tolerant rock inhabiting species tested. Meristematic fungi cannot be pre-adapted to higher growth temperatures by increased incubation temperatures. Considering the results of this study the justification of the term 'stress' is discussed with regard to rock inhabiting fungi and their natural environment. Consequences for conservation treatments of monuments decayed by meristematic fungi are discussed on the basis of the ecophysiological properties of the fungi.},

Black, meristematic fungi were isolated from surfaces of antique marble monuments in Antalya (Side, Perge, Termessos). Their morphology was characterized, their diversity was documented and the taxonomy and phylogeny of new isolates was clarified based on molecular methods, that is, by sequencing parts of the small ribosomal subunit (18S) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. From a total of around 250 samples 99 different fungal strains were isolated. In most of 99 strains the rDNA sequencing data and the lack of homologies in "Genbank" gave strong evidence that these strains have to be described as new species/subspecies and/or genera. All of them, however, clustered within the ascomycete orders of Dothideales, Chaetothyriales, and Pleosporales. Field studies show that these organisms cause color changes, black spots, crater shaped lesions as well as chipping and exfoliation of the rock surfaces in Antalya and thus they have to be regarded as a serious threat to the antique cultural heritage in Turkey.},

On the basis of ITS sequence, M-13 fingerprint and SSU intron data, two main entities could be distinguished within E. dermatitidis. One of these (B) contained prevalently strains from environmental sources, while the other (A) mainly comprised strains from clinical sources. This may be due to a difference in virulence.

effects and cell-type-independent positional effects. HeLa cells
were about 2-fold more responsive to siRNAs than SW3T3 cells but
displayed a very similar pattern of positional variation of lamin
A/C silencing. In HeLa cells, 26 of 44 tested standard 21-nucleotide
(nt) siRNA duplexes reduced the protein expression by at least 90{\%},
and only 2 duplexes reduced the lamin A/C proteins to {\textless}50{\%}. Fluorescent
chromophores did not perturb gene silencing when conjugated to the
5'-end or 3'-end of the sense siRNA strand and the 5'-end of the
antisense siRNA strand, but conjugation to the 3'-end of the antisense
siRNA abolished gene silencing. RNase-protecting phosphorothioate
and 2'-fluoropyrimidine RNA backbone modifications of siRNAs did
not significantly affect silencing efficiency, although cytotoxic
effects were observed when every second phosphate of an siRNA duplex
was replaced by phosphorothioate. Synthetic RNA hairpin loops were
subsequently evaluated for lamin A/C silencing as a function of stem
length and loop composition. As long as the 5'-end of the guide strand
coincided with the 5'-end of the hairpin RNA, 19-29 base pair (bp)
hairpins effectively silenced lamin A/C, but when the hairpin started
with the 5'-end of the sense strand, only 21-29 bp hairpins were
highly active.},

In this study, a three-dimensional (3D), air-exposed human epidermal skin equivalent was exploited to study Acinetobacter skin colonization. We characterized the adherence of A. baumannii ATCC 19606(T) and Acinetobacter junii RUH2228(T) to and biofilm formation on the skin equivalent and the responses to these bacteria. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of the disinfectant chlorhexidine to decolonize the skin equivalents. The results revealed that both strains replicated on the stratum corneum for up to 72 h but did not invade the epidermis. A. baumannii, in contrast to A. junii, formed large biofilms on the stratum corneum. Bacterial colonization did not affect keratinocyte activation, proliferation, or differentiation, nor did it induce a strong inflammatory response. Disinfection with chlorhexidine solution resulted in complete eradication of A. baumannii from the skin, without detrimental effects. This 3D model is a promising tool to study skin colonization and to evaluate the effects of novel disinfectant and antimicrobial strategies.},

The present work focuses on Alternaria infectoria, as a model organism of the genus, and was designed to unravel melanin production in the response to antifungals. After the characterization of the pigment produced by A. infectoria, we studied the dynamics of dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin production during growth, the degree of melanization in response to antifungals, and how melanization affected the susceptibility to several classes of therapeutic drugs. We demonstrate that A. infectoria increased melanin deposition in the cell walls in response to nikkomycin Z, caspofungin and itraconazole but not in response to fluconazole or amphotericin B. These results indicated that A. infectoria activates DHN-melanin synthesis in response to certain fungal drugs, possibly as a protective mechanism against antifungal drugs. Inhibition of DHN-melanin synthesis by pyroquilon resulted in a lower minimum effective concentration (MEC) of caspofungin, with enhanced morphological changes (increased balloon size) characterized by thinner and less organized A. infectoria cell walls. In summary, A. infectoria synthesizes melanin in response to certain antifungal drugs and its susceptibility is influenced by melanization suggesting a therapeutic potential to drug combinations that affect melanin synthesis.},

abstract = {Burn wound infections are often difficult to treat due to the presence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains and biofilms. Currently, mupirocin is used to eradicate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from colonized persons; however, mupirocin resistance is also emerging. Since we consider antimicrobial peptides to be promising candidates for the development of novel anti-infective agents, we studied the antibacterial activities of a set of synthetic peptides against different strains of S. aureus, including mupirocin-resistant MRSA strains. The peptides were derived from P60.4Ac, a peptide based on the human cathelicidin LL-37. The results showed that peptide 10 (P10) was the only peptide more efficient than P60.4Ac, which is better than LL-37, in killing MRSA strain LUH14616. All three peptides displayed good antibiofilm activities. However, both P10 and P60.4Ac were more efficient than LL-37 in eliminating biofilm-associated bacteria. No toxic effects of these three peptides on human epidermal models were detected, as observed morphologically and by staining for mitochondrial activity. In addition, P60.4Ac and P10, but not LL-37, eradicated MRSA LUH14616 and the mupirocin-resistant MRSA strain LUH15051 from thermally wounded human skin equivalents (HSE). Interestingly, P60.4Ac and P10, but not mupirocin, eradicated LUH15051 from the HSEs. None of the peptides affected the excretion of interleukin 8 (IL-8) by thermally wounded HSEs upon MRSA exposure. In conclusion, the synthetic peptides P60.4Ac and P10 appear to be attractive candidates for the development of novel local therapies to treat patients with burn wounds infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria.},

We investigated whether melanization affected the susceptibilities of the fungi to amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole, itraconazole, or flucytosine (5FC). Using the standard macrodilution MIC protocol (the M27A protocol) of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards for yeast, we found no difference in the susceptibilities of melanized and nonmelanized C. neoformans and H. capsulatum isolates. Killing assays demonstrated that melanization reduced the susceptibilities of both fungi to amphotericin B and caspofungin. Laccase-deficient C. neoformans cells grown with L-dopa were significantly more susceptible than congenic melanin-producing yeast to killing by amphotericin B or caspofungin. Preincubation of amphotericin B or caspofungin with melanins decreased their antifungal activities. Elemental analysis of melanins incubated with amphotericin B or caspofungin revealed an alteration in the C:N ratios of the melanins, which indicated binding of these drugs by the melanins. In contrast, incubation of fluconazole, itraconazole, or 5FC with melanins did not significantly affect the antifungal efficacies of the drugs or the chemical composition of the melanins. The results suggest a potential explanation for the inefficacy of caspofungin against C. neoformans in vivo, despite activity in vitro. Furthermore, the results indicate that fungal melanins protect C. neoformans and H. capsulatum from the activities of amphotericin B and caspofungin and that this protection is not demonstrable by standard broth macrodilution assays.},

Several observations demonstrate that detrimental mutations can be rescued by high magnesium concentrations, while stabilizing mutations lead to a lesser dependence on magnesium ion concentration. Recent data point to the central controlling and monitoring roles of RNA-binding proteins that can bind to the different folding stages, either before full establishment of the secondary structure or at the molten globule state before the cooperative transition to the final three-dimensional structure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The premature production of alpha-amylase without visible germination has been observed in developing grain of many cereals. The phenomenon is associated with cool temperatures in the late stages of grain growth but the mechanisms behind it are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to replicate the phenomenon under controlled conditions and investigate the possibility of a mechanistic link with grain size or endosperm cavity size.

METHODS: Five wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes differing in their susceptibility to premature alpha-amylase were subjected to a range of temperature shocks in controlled environments. A comparison was then made with plants grown under ambient conditions but with grain size altered by using degraining to increase the assimilate supply. At maturity, alpha-amylase, grain area and endosperm cavity area were measured in individual grains.

KEY RESULTS: Both cold and heat shocks were successful in inducing premature alpha-amylase in susceptible genotypes, with cold shocks the most effective. Cold shocks also increased grain area. Degraining resulted in increased grain area overall, but the larger grain did not have higher alpha-amylase. Analysis of individual grain found that instances of high alpha-amylase were not associated with differences in grain area or endosperm cavity area.

CONCLUSIONS: Pre-maturity alpha-amylase is associated with temperature shocks during grain filling. In some cases this coincides with an increase in grain area, but there is no evidence of a mechanistic link between high alpha-amylase and grain or endosperm cavity area.},

On tributyrin agar, hydrolysis zones were observed around or underneath the colonies. On rapeseed oil agar, no hydrolysis zones were formed, while most isolates formed such a zone on biodiesel oil agar. Rapeseed oil and biodiesel oil stimulated the growth of P. boydii isolates, while tributyrin inhibited fungal growth. The stimulation or inhibition effect of diesel oil was dependent on the specified strain. In clinical isolates, fungal growth and activity were found to be more variable compared to sludge isolates. The data suggest that contamination of the environment with these oils could favor the growth of P. boydii.

abstract = {We established a protoplast-based system to transfer DNA to Knufia petricola strain A95, a melanised rock-inhabiting microcolonial fungus that is also a component of a model sub-aerial biofilm (SAB) system. To test whether the desiccation resistant, highly melanised cell walls would hinder protoplast formation, we treated a melanin-minus mutant of A95 as well as the type-strain with a variety of cell-degrading enzymes. Of the different enzymes tested, lysing enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum were most effective in producing protoplasts. This mixture was equally effective on the melanin-minus mutant and the type-strain. Protoplasts produced using lysing enzymes were mixed with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and plasmid pCB1004 which contains the hygromycin B (HmB) phosphotransferase (hph) gene under the control of the Aspergillus nidulans trpC. Integration and expression of hph into the A95 genome conferred hygromycin resistance upon the transformants. Two weeks after plating out on selective agar containing HmB, the protoplasts developed cell-walls and formed colonies. Transformation frequencies were in the range 36 to 87 transformants per 10 {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashmu{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}g of vector DNA and 106 protoplasts. Stability of transformation was confirmed by sub-culturing the putative transformants on selective agar containing HmB as well as by PCR-detection of the hph gene in the colonies.

abstract = {We present biRNA, a novel algorithm for prediction of binding sites between two RNAs based on minimization of binding free energy. Similar
  to RNAup approach [30], we assume the binding free energy is the sum of accessibility and the interaction free energies. Our algorithm
  maintains tractability and speed and also has two important advantages over previous similar approaches: (1) biRNA is able to predict multiple simultaneous binding sites and (2) it computes a more accurate interaction free energy by considering
  both intramolecular and intermolecular base pairing. Moreover, biRNA can handle crossing interactions as well as hairpins interacting in a zigzag fashion. To deal with simultaneous accessibility
  of binding sites, our algorithm models their joint probability of being unpaired. Since computing the exact joint probability
  distribution is intractable, we approximate the joint probability by a polynomially representable graphical model namely a
  Chow-Liu tree-structured Markov Random Field. Experimental results show that biRNA outperforms RNAup and also support the accuracy of our approach. Our proposed Bayesian approximation of the Boltzmann joint probability distribution
  provides a powerful, novel framework that can also be utilized in other applications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Secondary structure forms an important intermediate level of description of nucleic acids that encapsulates the dominating part of the folding energy, is often well conserved in evolution, and is routinely used as a basis to explain experimental findings. Based on carefully measured thermodynamic parameters, exact dynamic programming algorithms can be used to compute ground states, base pairing probabilities, as well as thermodynamic properties.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure related computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model, the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs. New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format. Updates were implemented without compromising the computational efficiency of the core algorithms and ensuring compatibility with earlier versions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The ViennaRNA Package 2.0, supporting concurrent computations via OpenMP, can be downloaded from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA.},

abstract = {Fungi that tolerate very high environmental NaCl concentrations are good model systems to study mechanisms that enable them to endure osmotic and salinity stress. The whole genome sequences of six such fungal species have been analysed: Hortaea werneckii, Wallemia ichthyophaga and four Aureobasidium spp.: A. pullulans, A. subglaciale, A. melanogenum and A. namibiae. These fungi show different levels of halotolerance, with the presence of numerous membrane transport systems uncovered here that are believed to maintain physiological intracellular concentrations of alkali metal cations. Despite some differences, the intracellular cation contents of H. werneckii, A. pullulans and W. ichthyophaga remain low even under extreme extracellular salinities, which suggests that these species have efficient cation transport systems. We speculate that cation transporters prevent intracellular accumulation of Na(+), and thus avoid the toxic effects that such Na(+) accumulation would have, while also maintaining the high K(+)/Na(+) ratio that is required for the full functioning of the cell - another crucial task in high-Na(+) environments. This chapter primarily summarises the cation transport systems of these selected fungi, and it also describes other membrane transporters that might be involved in their mechanisms of halotolerance.},

In this work, three white-rot fungi were used to degrade a mixture of PCBs at high initial concentrations from 600 to 3000 mg/l, in the presence of a non-ionic surfactant (Tween 80). The PCBs were extracted from a historically PCB-contaminated soil. Preliminary experiments showed that Tween 80 exhibited the highest emulsification index of the three surfactants tested (Tergitol NP-10, Triton X-100 and Tween 80). Tween 80 had no inhibitory effect on fungal radial growth, whereas the other surfactants inhibited the growth rate by 75–95{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}. Three initial PCB concentrations (600, 1800 and 3000 mg/l) were assayed with three fungi for the PCB degradation tests.

abstract = {No abstract. Introduction: Both natural and anthropogenic sources contribute to the presence of toluene in the environment. Toluene is found naturally in petroleum and coal, and is a major component of gasoline; it is also produced by the burning of organic materials and has been detected in cigarette smoke (Cline et al., 1991,Darrall et al., 1998, Koppmann et al., 1997 and Sinninghe Damste et al., 1992). Toluene is also produced industrially for use as a solvent and in the production of various chemicals. In addition, toluene is produced and emitted by plants (Heiden et al., 1999, Holzinger et al., 2000 and Vrkocova et al., 2000). Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), which together represent a significant fraction of the aromatic hydrocarbons in gasoline, are known or suspected carcinogens (Dean, 1985 and Snyder, 2002) and present a serious threat to drinking water supplies because of their relatively high aqueous solubilities. A significant amount of effort has gone into the study of toluene fate in the environment and the contribution of biodegradation to its removal. Because of the stability of the benzene ring, the initial step in toluene degradation is the most difficult. Aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene are significantly more reduced than cellular organic material and thus must be oxidized prior to assimilation. Bacteria and fungi have evolved a variety of interesting pathways for the degradation of toluene. An overview of known toluene degradation pathways is shown in Fig. 1.1. Under aerobic conditions, oxygen is used directly as a substrate, destabilizing the aromatic ring and preparing the molecule for further metabolism. Some bacteria use a dioxygenase to catalyze the formation of a cis-dihydrodiol product, which is then subjected to dehydrogenation to form 3-methylcatechol. Other bacteria have monooxygenases that catalyze the initial hydroxylation at the ortho, meta, or para position of toluene, which is then followed by a second hydroxylation by the same or a different hydroxylase to form catecholic products. Alternatively, the methyl group of toluene may undergo oxidation prior to conversion to a catechol as in the TOL pathway (Fig. 1.1). A recently described fungal pathway uses a variation of the TOL pathway. Thus, in the aerobic pathways, catechol and its derivatives generally serve as central metabolites in aerobic toluene degradation, and several of the pathways converge at a common intermediate (Fig. 1.1). Catechols are then cleaved by either an extradiol (meta) or intradiol (ortho) ring fission reaction, again with oxygen participating as a substrate. In the absence of available oxygen, a completely different degradation strategy must be used. To initiate toluene degradation, anaerobic toluene degraders carry out a unique reaction that adds fumarate to toluene (Fig. 1.1). The product of this reaction, benzylsuccinate, is further metabolized by a series of $\beta$-oxidation-like reactions to yield benzoyl-CoA, a central intermediate of anaerobic aromatic degradation. Benzoyl-CoA is then metabolized to TCA cycle intermediates by a pathway that involves ring reduction prior to a series of reactions similar to $\beta$-oxidation and ring cleavage. This review compares the details of the known bacterial pathways and a fungal pathway for the complete degradation of toluene.},

With the substrate without disulphide bonds (casein) no stimulation was found, and reducing agents inhibited proteolysis in most cases. With the remaining two substrates, all substances enhanced the activity of proteases probably through the cleavage of the substrate disulphide bonds. Sulphite was more effective than the four used thiols and enhanced the activity against serum albumin up to 3.2 times and against keratin up to 2.9 times. Using sulphitolysed sheep wool, keratinolytic activity increased after sulphitolysis of more than 20{\%} of disulphide bonds. With the fully sulphitolysed wool the activity increased 43 times. The obtained results support the author's hypothesis on keratin degradation by sulphite excretion prior to attack by fungal proteases. Stimulation of proteolysis and keratinolysis by cleavage of disulphide bonds is not specific for dermatophytic proteases because trypsin and pronase behaved similarly in the experiments.},

abstract = {Dermatophytes are keratinophilic fungi that can be pathogenic for humans and animals by infecting the stratum corneum, nails, claws or hair. The first infection step consists of adherence of arthroconidia to the stratum corneum. The mechanisms and the kinetics of adherence have been investigated using different in vitro and ex vivo experimental models, most notably showing the role of a secreted serine protease from Microsporum canis in fungal adherence to feline corneocytes. After germination of the arthroconidia, dermatophytes invade keratinised structures that have to be digested into short peptides and amino acids to be assimilated. Although many proteases, including keratinolytic ones, have been characterised, the understanding of dermatophyte invasion mechanisms remains speculative. To date, research on mechanisms of dermatophyte infection focused mainly on both secreted endoproteases and exoproteases, but their precise role in both fungal adherence and skin invasion should be further explored.},

abstract = {We have demonstrated that the 80 kDa POP Tc80 (prolyl oligopeptidase of Trypanosoma cruzi) is involved in the process of cell invasion, since specific inhibitors block parasite entry into non-phagocytic mammalian host cells. In contrast with other POPs, POP Tc80 is capable of hydrolysing large substrates, such as fibronectin and native collagen. In this study, we present the cloning of the POPTc80 gene, whose deduced amino acid sequence shares considerable identity with other members of the POP family, mainly within its C-terminal portion that forms the catalytic domain. Southern-blot analysis indicated that POPTc80 is present as a single copy in the genome of the parasite. These results are consistent with mapping of POPTc80 to a single chromosome. The active recombinant protein (rPOP Tc80) displayed kinetic properties comparable with those of the native enzyme. Novel inhibitors were assayed with rPOP Tc80, and the most efficient ones presented values of inhibition coefficient Ki {\textless} or = 1.52 nM. Infective parasites treated with these specific POP Tc80 inhibitors attached to the surface of mammalian host cells, but were incapable of infecting them. Structural modelling of POP Tc80, based on the crystallized porcine POP, suggested that POP Tc80 is composed of an alpha/beta-hydrolase domain containing the catalytic triad Ser548-Asp631-His667 and a seven-bladed beta-propeller non-catalytic domain. Docking analysis suggests that triple-helical collagen access to the catalytic site of POP Tc80 occurs in the vicinity of the interface between the two domains.},

abstract = {Zinc ion homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled primarily through the transcriptional regulation of zinc uptake systems in response to intracellular zinc levels. A high-affinity uptake system is encoded by the ZRT1 gene, and its expression is induced more than 30-fold in zinc-limited cells. A low-affinity transporter is encoded by the ZRT2 gene, and this system is also regulated by zinc. We used a genetic approach to isolate mutants whose ZRT1 expression is no longer repressed in zinc-replete cells, and a new gene, ZAP1, was identified. ZAP1 encodes a 93-kDa protein with sequence similarity to transcriptional activators; the C-terminal 174 amino acids contains five C2H2 zinc finger domains, and the N terminus (residues 1 to 706) has two potential acidic activation domains. The N-terminal region also contains 12{\%} histidine and cysteine residues. The mutant allele isolated, ZAP1-1up, is semidominant and caused high-level expression of ZRT1 and ZRT2 in both zinc-limited and zinc-replete cells. This phenotype is the result of a mutation that substitutes a serine for a cysteine residue in the N-terminal region. A zap1 deletion mutant grew well on zinc-replete media but poorly on zinc-limiting media. This mutant had low-level ZRT1 and ZRT2 expression in zinc-limited as well as zinc-replete cells. These data indicate that Zap1p plays a central role in zinc ion homeostasis by regulating transcription of the zinc uptake system genes in response to zinc. Finally, we present evidence that Zap1p regulates transcription of its own promoter in response to zinc through a positive autoregulatory mechanism.},

A high affinity system is active in zinc-limited cells, and the ZRT1 gene encodes the transporter protein of this system. In this study, we characterized the low affinity system that is active in zinc-replete cells. The low affinity system is time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent and prefers zinc over other metals as its substrate. Our results suggest that the ZRT2 gene encodes the transporter of this system. The amino acid sequence of Zrt2p is remarkably similar to those of Zrt1p and Irt1p, an Fe2+ transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpressing ZRT2 increased low affinity uptake, whereas disrupting this gene eliminated that activity, but had little effect on the high affinity system. Therefore, the high and low affinity systems are separate uptake pathways. Analysis of the zinc levels required for growth of zrt2 mutant strains as well as the effects of the zrt2 mutation on the regulation of the high affinity system demonstrated that the low affinity system is a biologically relevant mechanism of zinc accumulation. Finally, a zrt1zrt2 mutant was viable, indicating the existence of additional zinc uptake pathways.},

The predicted amino acid sequence of Zrt1p is similar to that of Irt1p, a probable Fe(II) transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana. Like Irt1p, Zrt1p contains eight potential transmembrane domains and a possible metal-binding domain. Consistent with the proposed role of ZRT1 in zinc uptake, overexpressing this gene increased high-affinity uptake activity, whereas disrupting it eliminated that activity and resulted in poor growth of the mutant in zinc-limited media. Furthermore, ZRT1 mRNA levels and uptake activity were closely correlated, as was zinc-limited induction of a ZRT1-lacZ fusion. These results suggest that ZRT1 is regulated at the transcriptional level by the intracellular concentration of zinc. ZRT1 is an additional member of a growing family of metal transport proteins.},

Its nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of a single open reading frame (ORF; 1326 bp) having the potential to encode a protein of 442 amino acid residues (molecular mass of 48.3 kDa). A frameshift mutation introduced within the ORF abolished resistance to heavy metal ions, indicating the ORF is required for resistance. Therefore, we termed it the ZRC1 (zinc resistance conferring) gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product predicts a rather hydrophobic protein with six possible membrane-spanning regions. While multiple copies of the ZRC1 gene enable yeast cells to grow in the presence of 40 mM Zn2+, a level at which wild-type cells cannot survive, the disruption of the chromosomal ZRC1 locus, though not a lethal event, makes cells more sensitive to zinc ions than are wild-type cells.},

abstract = {The COT1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been isolated as a dosage-dependent suppressor of cobalt toxicity. Overexpression of the COT1 gene confers increased tolerance to cobalt and rhodium ions but not other divalent cations. Strains containing null alleles of COT1 are viable yet more sensitive to cobalt than are wild-type strains. Transcription of COT1 responds minimally to the extracellular cobalt concentration. Addition of cobalt ions to growth media results in a twofold increase in COT1 mRNA abundance. The gene encodes a 48-kDa protein which is found in mitochondrial membrane fractions of cells. The protein contains six possible membrane-spanning domains and several potential metal-binding amino acid residues. The COT1 protein shares 60{\%} identity with the ZRC1 gene product, which confers resistance to zinc and cadmium ions. Cobalt transport studies indicate that the COT1 product is involved in the uptake of cobalt ions yet is not solely responsible for it. The increased tolerance of strains containing multiple copies of the COT1 gene is probably due to increased compartmentalization or sequestration of the ion within mitochondria.},

abstract = {Throughout evolution, all organisms have harnessed the redox properties of copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) as a cofactor or structural determinant of proteins that perform critical functions in biology. At its most sobering stance to Earth's biome, Cu biochemistry allows photosynthetic organisms to harness solar energy and convert it into the organic energy that sustains the existence of all nonphotosynthetic life forms. The conversion of organic energy, in the form of nutrients that include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids, is subsequently released during cellular respiration, itself a Cu-dependent process, and stored as ATP that is used to drive a myriad of critical biological processes such as enzyme-catalyzed biosynthetic processes, transport of cargo around cells and across membranes, and protein degradation. The life-supporting properties of Cu incur a significant challenge to cells that must not only exquisitely balance intracellular Cu concentrations, but also chaperone this redox-active metal from its point of cellular entry to its ultimate destination so as to avert the potential for inappropriate biochemical interactions or generation of damaging reactive oxidative species (ROS). In this review we chart the travels of Cu from the extracellular milieu of fungal and mammalian cells, its path within the cytosol as inferred by the proteins and ligands that escort and deliver Cu to intracellular organelles and protein targets, and its journey throughout the body of mammals.

abstract = {Fungal pathogens have evolved sophisticated machinery to precisely balance the fine line between acquiring essential metals and defending against metal toxicity. Iron and copper are essential metals for many processes in both fungal pathogens and their mammalian hosts, but reduce viability when present in excess. However, during infection, the host uses these two metals differently. Fe has a long-standing history of influencing virulence in pathogenic fungi, mostly in regards to Fe acquisition. Numerous studies demonstrate the requirement of the Fe acquisition pathway of Candida, Cryptococcus and Aspergillus for successful systemic infection. Fe is not free in the host, but is associated with Fe-binding proteins, leading fungi to develop mechanisms to interact with and to acquire Fe from these Fe-bound proteins. Cu is also essential for cell growth and development. Essential Cu-binding proteins include Fe transporters, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cytochrome c oxidase. Although Cu acquisition plays critical roles in fungal survival in the host, recent work has revealed that Cu detoxification is extremely important. Here, we review fungal responses to altered metal conditions presented by the host, contrast the roles of Fe and Cu during infection, and outline the critical roles of fungal metal homeostasis machinery at the host-pathogen axis.},

abstract = {Copper and iron uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are linked through a high-affinity ferric/ cupric-reductive uptake system. Evidence suggests that a similar system operates in Candida albicans. The authors have identified a C. albicans gene that is able to rescue a S. cerevisiae ctr1/ctr3-null mutant defective in high-affinity copper uptake. The 756 bp ORF, designated CaCTR1, encodes a 251 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 27?8 kDa. Comparisons between the deduced amino acid sequence of the C. albicans Ctr1p and S. cerevisiae Ctr1p indicated that they share 39?6{\%} similarity and 33?0{\%} identity over their entire length. Within the predicted protein product of CaCTR1 there are putative transmembrane regions and sequences that resemble copper-binding motifs. The promoter region of CaCTR1 contains four sequences with significant identity to S. cerevisiae copper response elements. CaCTR1 is transcriptionally regulated in S. cerevisiae in response to copper availability by the copper-sensing transactivator Mac1p. Transcription of CaCTR1 in C. albicans is also regulated in a copper-responsive manner. This raises the possibility that CaCTR1 may be regulated in C. albicans by a Mac1p-like transactivator. A C. albicans ctr1-null mutant displays phenotypes consistent with the lack of copper uptake including growth defects in low-copper and low-iron conditions, a respiratory deficiency and sensitivity to oxidative stress. Furthermore, changes in morphology were observed in the C. albicans ctr1-null mutant. It is proposed that CaCTR1 facilitates transport of copper into the cell. INTRODUCTION Copper is an important cofactor for a wide variety of cellular enzymes that carry out essential biological processes such as respiration, iron acquisition and protection against oxidative stress. The problem, however, is that copper exists in the environment as insoluble complexes and is toxic in the presence of oxygen because of the formation of destructive hydroxyl free radicals. Therefore, organisms have evolved mechanisms for the transport of copper into the cell and for maintaining intracellular concentrations at non-toxic levels. In the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a welldocumented system has been described where the acquisition of copper is linked to the acquisition of iron. Like copper, iron},

abstract = {Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal human pathogen with a bipolar mating system. It undergoes a dimorphic transition from a unicellular yeast to hyphal filamentous growth during mating and monokaryotic fruiting. The traditional sexual cycle that leads to the production of infectious basidiospores involves cells of both alpha and a mating type. Monokaryotic fruiting is a modified form of sexual reproduction that involves cells of the same mating type, most commonly alpha, which is the predominant mating type in both the environment and clinical isolates. However, some a isolates can also undergo monokaryotic fruiting. To determine whether mating type and other genetic loci contribute to the differences in fruiting observed between alpha and a cells, we applied quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to an inbred population of F2 progeny. We discovered that variation in hyphal length produced during fruiting is a quantitative trait resulting from the combined effects of multiple genetic loci, including the mating type (MAT) locus. Importantly, the alpha allele of the MAT locus enhanced hyphal growth compared with the a allele. Other virulence traits, including melanization and growth at 39 degrees C, also are quantitative traits that share a common QTL with hyphal growth. The Mac1 transcription factor, encoded in this common QTL, regulates copper homeostasis. MAC1 allelic differences contribute to phenotypic variation, and mac1Delta mutants exhibit defects in filamentation, melanin production, and high temperature growth. Further characterization of these QTL regions will reveal additional quantitative trait genes controlling biological processes central to fungal development and pathogenicity.},

This factor is specific for SOD1 and does not deliver copper to proteins in the mitochondria, nucleus, or secretory pathway. Yeast cells containing alys7$\Delta$ null mutation have normal levels of SOD1 protein, but fail to incorporate copper into SOD1, which is therefore devoid of superoxide scavenging activity.

Virulence of C. albicans requires a copper and zinc containing superoxide dismutase (SOD1), but the biology of C. albicans SOD1 is poorly understood. To this end, C. albicans SOD1 activation was examined in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), a eukaryotic expression system that has proven fruitful for the study of SOD1 enzymes from invertebrates, plants, and mammals. In spite of the 80{\%} similarity between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans SOD1 molecules, C. albicans SOD1 is not active in S. cerevisiae. The SOD1 appears incapable of productive interactions with the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS1) of S. cerevisiae. C. albicans SOD1 contains a proline at position 144 predicted to dictate dependence on CCS1. By mutation of this proline, C. albicans SOD1 gained activity in S. cerevisiae, and this activity was independent of CCS1. We identified a putative CCS1 gene in C. albicans and created heterozygous and homozygous gene deletions at this locus. Loss of CCS1 resulted in loss of SOD1 activity, consistent with its role as a copper chaperone. C. albicans CCS1 also restored activity to C. albicans SOD1 expressed in S. cerevisiae. C. albicans CCS1 is well adapted for activating its partner SOD1 from C. albicans, but not SOD1 from S. cerevisiae. In spite of the high degree of homology between the SOD1 and CCS1 molecules in these two fungal species, there exists a species-specific barrier in CCS-SOD interactions which may reflect the vastly different lifestyles of the pathogenic versus the noninfectious yeast.},

Here, we used Agrobacterium to isolate insertional mutants and screened 12 000 mutants to uncover genes involved in melanin production in C. neoformans. Four new mutant alleles of the well-known melanin biosynthesis gene, LAC1, which encodes laccase were identified, and the T-DNA was shown to have a possible predisposition for insertion into the promoters of genes, in particular LAC1. Melanization in C. neoformans is dependent on five additional genes identified in this screen encoding homologues of the copper transporter Ccc2, the copper chaperone Atx1, the chitin synthase Chs3, the transcriptional coactivator Mbf1 and the chromatin-remodelling enzyme Snf5.

abstract = {The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans causes lethal systemic infections because of its ability to grow and disseminate in a host. The C. albicans plasma membrane is essential for virulence by acting as a protective barrier and through its key roles in interfacing with the environment, secretion of virulence factors, morphogenesis, and cell wall synthesis. Difficulties in studying hydrophobic membranes have limited the understanding of how plasma membrane organization contributes to its function and to the actions of antifungal drugs. Therefore, the role of the recently discovered plasma membrane subdomains termed the membrane compartment containing Can1 (MCC) was analyzed by assessing the virulence of a sur7$\Delta$ mutant. Sur7 is an integral membrane protein component of the MCC that is needed for proper localization of actin, morphogenesis, cell wall synthesis, and responding to cell wall stress. MCC domains are stable 300-nm-sized punctate patches that associate with a complex of cytoplasmic proteins known as an eisosome. Analysis of virulence-related properties of a sur7$\Delta$ mutant revealed defects in intraphagosomal growth in macrophages that correlate with increased sensitivity to oxidation and copper. The sur7$\Delta$ mutant was also strongly defective in pathogenesis in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. The mutant cells showed a decreased ability to initiate an infection and greatly diminished invasive growth into kidney tissues. These studies on Sur7 demonstrate that the plasma membrane MCC domains are critical for virulence and represent an important new target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. IMPORTANCECandida albicans, the most common human fungal pathogen, causes lethal systemic infections by growing and disseminating in a host. The plasma membrane plays key roles in enabling C. albicans to grow in vivo, and it is also the target of the most commonly used antifungal drugs. However, plasma membrane organization is poorly understood because of the experimental difficulties in studying hydrophobic components. Interestingly, recent studies have identified a novel type of plasma membrane subdomain in fungi known as the membrane compartment containing Can1 (MCC). Cells lacking the MCC-localized protein Sur7 display broad defects in cellular organization and response to stress in vitro. Consistent with this, C. albicans cells lacking the SUR7 gene were more susceptible to attack by macrophages than cells with the gene and showed greatly reduced virulence in a mouse model of systemic infection. Thus, Sur7 and other MCC components represent novel targets for antifungal therapy.},

The gene encodes a 649-amino-acid protein showing high identity with other members of the hsp70 gene family. The hsp70 gene is induced during both heat shock of yeast cells at 42 degrees C and the mycelial to yeast transition. A differential expression of this gene can be observed between mycelial and yeast forms, with a much higher level of expression in the yeast. We found two introns of 178 and 72 nucleotides in the P. brasiliensis hsp70 gene. Splicing of these introns is regulated during the heat shock process and possibly during infection. In order to analyse the differential accumulation of unspliced mRNA following cellular differentiation and/or heat shock, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments were carried out. The temperature-induced mycelial to yeast transition results in the transient accumulation of unspliced hsp70 mRNA transcripts. Yeast cells, after adaptation at 36 degrees C, seem to be more proficient at splicing, at least with respect to hsp70 mRNA because, during a severe heat shock (42 degrees C), the unspliced form of this mRNA does not accumulate. The mycelial to yeast differentiation will have the adaptational effect of increasing the resistance of the organism to environmental stress, which may be necessary for parasite survival in the mammalian host.},

abstract = {Based on the analysis of structural features and conserved elements, 27 novel snoRNA genes have been identified from rice. All of them belong to the C/D box-containing snoRNA family except for one that belongs to the H/ACA box type. The newly found genes fall into six clusters that comprise at least three snoRNA genes, and in one case as many as nine genes. Interestingly, four of the six clusters are located within the largest intron of a protein coding gene. The majority of intronic snoRNA gene clusters are simply formed by multiple copies of the same species of snoRNA gene that possess the identical functional elements. This implies a possible mechanism of duplication for the origin of repeating snoRNA coding regions in one intron. However, a few intronic snoRNA gene clusters consisting of different snoRNAs species were also observed. Polycistronic precursors from two independently transcribed clusters were demonstrated by RT-PCR and individual snoRNAs processed from the polycistronic precursors were positively determined by reverse transcription assay. Analyses of the intergenic spacers in the clusters showed that, in addition to a very high AT content, the processing signals in rice snoRNA polycistronic transcripts might be different from those of yeast. Our results demonstrate that, in both plants and mammals, numerous snoRNAs can be produced simultaneously from an mRNA precursor of a host gene despite the different arrangements. The intronic snoRNA gene cluster is a novel gene organization, which is so far unique to plants. The conservation of intronic snoRNA gene clusters in plants was further demonstrated by the study of a similar snoRNA gene organization in the first intron of a Hsp70 gene from wild rice and Zizania caduciflora.},

abstract = {U14 is a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) required for early cleavages of eukaryotic precursor rRNA. The U14 RNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is distinguished from its vertebrate homologues by the presence of a stem-loop domain that is essential for function. This element, known as the Y-domain, is located in the U14 sequence between two universal sequences that base pair with 18S rRNA. Sequence data obtained for the U14 homologues from four additional phylogenetically distinct yeasts showed the Y-domain is not unique to S.cerevisiae. Comparison of the five Y-domain sequences revealed a common stem-loop structure with a conserved loop sequence that includes eight invariant nucleotides. Conservation of these features suggests that the Y-domain is a recognition signal for an essential interaction. Several plant U14 RNAs were found to contain similar structures, though with an unrelated consensus sequence in the loop portion. The U14 gene from the most distantly related yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, was found to be active in S.cerevisiae, showing that Y-domain function is conserved and that U14 function can be provided by variants in which the essential elements are embedded in dissimilar flanking sequences. This last result suggests that U14 function may be determined solely by the essential elements.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 lon mutants have phenotypes of deficiencies in cell division, swarming, twitching, and biofilm formation as well as a phenotype of ciprofloxacin supersusceptibility. In this study, we demonstrated that a lon mutant was also supersensitive to the DNA-damaging agent UV light. To understand the influence of lon in causing these phenotypes, global gene expression was characterized by performing microarrays on the lon mutant and the PAO1 wild type grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin. This revealed major differences in the expression of genes involved in the SOS response and DNA repair. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed that these genes were highly upregulated upon ciprofloxacin exposure in the wild type but were significantly less induced in the lon mutant, indicating that Lon modulates the SOS response and consequentially ciprofloxacin susceptibility. As the known Lon target SulA is a member of the SOS response regulon, the influence of mutating or overexpressing this gene, and the negative regulator of the SOS response, LexA, was examined. Overexpression of lexA had no effect on the Lon-related phenotypes, but sulA overexpression recapitulated certain lon mutant phenotypes, including altered motility and cell division, indicating that Lon regulates these phenotypes through SulA. However, sulA overexpression did not affect ciprofloxacin susceptibility or biofilm formation, indicating that these properties were independently determined. Lon protease was also demonstrated to strongly influence RecA protein accumulation in the presence of ciprofloxacin. A model of DNA repair involving the Lon protease is proposed.},

We report a case of oral Exophiala infection in a 39-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Clinical records of the patient were reviewed and the following additional information was collected: histological and microbiological evidence; identification of the causative organism; in vitro antifungal susceptibility. RESULTS: The patient developed a necrotic ulcer surrounded by a violaceous rim in the gingiva during neutropenia. Exophiala dermatitidis was identified as the causative organism by histopathological examination and culture, and finally confirmed by sequencing of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed space domain. In vitro, amphotericin B was found to show strong activity against the Exophiala isolate while itraconazole showed less activity. The patient was successfully treated with parenteral amphotericin B and oral itraconazole in combination with surgical removal of the fungi focus. CONCLUSION: Local excision with adequate antifungal agents can be used to treat immunocompromised patients with Exophiala stomatitis, based on early diagnosis.},

Under certain circumstances, however, C. albicans can cause infections that range from superficial infections of the skin to life-threatening systemic infections. Several factors and activities have been identified which contribute to the pathogenic potential of this fungus. Among them are molecules which mediate adhesion to and invasion into host cells, the secretion of hydrolases, the yeast-to-hypha transition, contact sensing and thigmotropism, biofilm formation, phenotypic switching and a range of fitness attributes. Our understanding of when and how these mechanisms and factors contribute to infection has significantly increased during the last years. In addition, novel virulence mechanisms have recently been discovered. In this review we present an update on our current understanding of the pathogenicity mechanisms of this important human pathogen.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae preferentially uses glucose as a carbon source, but following its depletion, it can utilize a wide variety of other carbons including nonfermentable compounds such as ethanol. A shift to a nonfermentable carbon source results in massive reprogramming of gene expression including genes involved in gluconeogenesis, the glyoxylate cycle, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This review is aimed at describing the recent progress made toward understanding the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of genes responsible for utilization of nonfermentable carbon sources. A central player for the use of nonfermentable carbons is the Snf1 kinase, which becomes activated under low glucose levels. Snf1 phosphorylates various targets including the transcriptional repressor Mig1, resulting in its inactivation allowing derepression of gene expression. For example, the expression of CAT8, encoding a member of the zinc cluster family of transcriptional regulators, is then no longer repressed by Mig1. Cat8 becomes activated through phosphorylation by Snf1, allowing upregulation of the zinc cluster gene SIP4. These regulators control the expression of various genes including those involved in gluconeogenesis. Recent data show that another zinc cluster protein, Rds2, plays a key role in regulating genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate pathway. Finally, the role of additional regulators such as Adr1, Ert1, Oaf1, and Pip2 is also discussed.},

abstract = {The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is both a benign gut commensal and a frequently fatal systemic pathogen. The interaction of C. albicans with the host's innate immune system is the primary factor in this balance; defects in innate immunity predispose the patient to disseminated candidiasis. Because of the central importance of phagocytic cells in defense against fungal infections, we have investigated the response of C. albicans to phagocytosis by mammalian macrophages using genomic transcript profiling. This analysis reveals a dramatic reprogramming of transcription in C. albicans that occurs in two successive steps. In the early phase cells shift to a starvation mode, including gluconeogenic growth, activation of fatty acid degradation, and downregulation of translation. In a later phase, as hyphal growth enables C. albicans to escape from the macrophage, cells quickly resume glycolytic growth. In addition, there is a substantial nonmetabolic response imbedded in the early phase, including machinery for DNA damage repair, oxidative stress responses, peptide uptake systems, and arginine biosynthesis. Further, a surprising percentage of the genes that respond specifically to macrophage contact have no known homologs, suggesting that the organism has undergone substantial evolutionary adaptations to the commensal or pathogen lifestyle. This transcriptional reprogramming is almost wholly absent in the related, but nonpathogenic, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that these large-scale and coordinated changes contribute significantly to the ability of this organism to survive and cause disease in vivo.},

abstract = {The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can grow for generations in the absence of exogenous iron, indicating a capacity to store intracellular iron. As cells can accumulate iron by endocytosis we studied iron metabolism in yeast that were defective in endocytosis. We demonstrated that endocytosis-defective yeast (Delta end4) can store iron in the vacuole, indicating a transfer of iron from the cytosol to the vacuole. Using several different criteria we demonstrated that CCC1 encodes a transporter that effects the accumulation of iron and Mn(2+) in vacuoles. Overexpression of CCC1, which is localized to the vacuole, lowers cytosolic iron and increases vacuolar iron content. Conversely, deletion of CCC1 results in decreased vacuolar iron content and decreased iron stores, which affect cytosolic iron levels and cell growth. Furthermore Delta ccc1 cells show increased sensitivity to external iron. The sensitivity to iron is exacerbated by ectopic expression of the iron transporter FET4. These results indicate that yeast can store iron in the vacuole and that CCC1 is involved in the transfer of iron from the cytosol to the vacuole.},

Under zinc limitation, ZRT1 and ZRT2 transcription is induced by the Zap1p transcriptional activator. We describe here a new component of zinc homeostasis, vacuolar zinc storage, that is also regulated by Zap1p. Zinc-replete cells accumulate zinc in the vacuole via the Zrc1p and Cot1p transporters. Our results indicate that another zinc transporter, Zrt3p, mobilizes this stored zinc in zinc-limited cells. ZRT3 is a Zap1p-regulated gene whose transcription increases in low zinc. Zrt3p is also a member of the ZIP family and it localizes to the vacuolar membrane. The effects of ZRT3 mutation and overexpression on cell growth, cellular zinc accumulation and intracellular labile zinc pools are all consistent with its proposed role. Furthermore, we demonstrate that zrt3 mutants inefficiently mobilize stored zinc to offset deficiency. Thus, our studies define a system of zinc influx and efflux transporters in the vacuole that play important roles in zinc homeostasis.},

abstract = {Copper is an essential trace metal whose biological utility is derived from its ability to cycle between oxidized Cu(II) and reduced Cu(I). Ctr1 is a high affinity plasma membrane copper permease, conserved from yeast to humans, that mediates the physiological uptake of Cu(I) from the extracellular environment. In the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extracellular Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) via the action of the cell surface metalloreductase Fre1, similar to the human gp91(phox) subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex, which utilizes heme and flavins to catalyze electron transfer. The S. cerevisiae Ctr2 protein is structurally similar to Ctr1, localizes to the vacuole membrane, and mobilizes vacuolar copper stores to the cytosol via a mechanism that is not well understood. Here we show that Ctr2-1, a mutant form of Ctr2 that mislocalizes to the plasma membrane, requires the Fre1 plasma membrane metalloreductase for Cu(I) import. The conserved methionine residues that are essential for Ctr1 function at the plasma membrane are also essential for Ctr2-1-mediated Cu(I) uptake. We demonstrate that Fre6, a member of the yeast Fre1 metalloreductase protein family, resides on the vacuole membrane and functions in Ctr2-mediated vacuolar copper export, and cells lacking Fre6 phenocopy the Cu-deficient growth defect of ctr2Delta cells. Furthermore, both CTR2 and FRE6 mRNA levels are regulated by iron availability. Taken together these studies suggest that copper movement across intracellular membranes is mechanistically similar to that at the plasma membrane. This work provides a model for communication between the extracellular Cu(I) uptake and the intracellular Cu(I) mobilization machinery.},

Onygena corvina, a non-pathogenic fungus, grows specifically on feathers, hooves, horn, and hair in nature. Hence, the proteases secreted by O. corvina are interesting in view of their potential relevance for industrial decomposition of keratinaceous wastes. We sequenced and assembled the genome of O. corvina and used a method called peptide pattern recognition to identify 73 different proteases. Comparative genome analysis of proteases in keratin-degrading and non-keratin-degrading fungi indicated that 18 putative secreted proteases from four protease families (M36, M35, M43, and S8) may be responsible for keratin decomposition. Twelve of the 18 predicted protease genes could be amplified from O. corvina grown on keratinaceous materials and were transformed into Pichia pastoris. One of the recombinant proteases belonging to the S8 family showed high keratin-degrading activity. Furthermore, 29 different proteases were identified by mass spectrometry in the culture broth of O. corvina grown on feathers and bristle. The culture broth was fractionated by ion exchange chromatography to isolate active fractions with five novel proteases belonging to three protease families (S8, M28, and M3). Enzyme blends composed of three of these five proteases, one from each family, showed high degree of degradation of keratin in vitro. A blend of novel proteases, such as those we discovered, could possibly find a use for degrading keratinaceous wastes and provide proteins, peptides, and amino acids as valuable ingredients for animal feed.},

However, little is known about the pathogenicity of this specialized group of filamentous fungi, for which molecular research has been limited thus far.

By the establishment of the first genetic system for A. benhamiae, specific $\Delta$acuE mutants were constructed in a wild-type strain and, in addition, in a derivative in which we inactivated the nonhomologous end-joining pathway by deletion of the A. benhamiae KU70 gene. The absence of AbenKU70 resulted in an increased frequency of the targeted insertion of linear DNA by homologous recombination, without notably altering the monitored in vitro growth abilities of the fungus or its virulence in a guinea pig infection model. Phenotypic analyses of $\Delta$acuE mutants and complemented strains depicted that malate synthase is required for the growth of A. benhamiae on lipids, major constituents of the skin. However, mutant analysis did not reveal a pathogenic role of the A. benhamiae enzyme in guinea pig dermatophytosis or during epidermal invasion of the fungus in an in vitro model of reconstituted human epidermis. The presented efficient system for targeted genetic manipulation in A. benhamiae, paired with the analyzed infection models, will advance the functional characterization of putative virulence determinants in medically important dermatophytes.},

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common and deadly pulmonary fungal infection worldwide. In the lung, the fungus usually forms a dense colony of filaments embedded in a polymeric extracellular matrix. To identify candidate genes involved in this biofilm (BF) growth, we used RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptomes of BF and liquid plankton (PL) growth. Sequencing and mapping of tens of millions sequence reads against the A. fumigatus transcriptome identified 3,728 differentially regulated genes in the two conditions. Although many of these genes, including the ones coding for transcription factors, stress response, the ribosome, and the translation machinery, likely reflect the different growth demands in the two conditions, our experiment also identified hundreds of candidate genes for the observed differences in morphology and pathobiology between BF and PL. We found an overrepresentation of upregulated genes in transport, secondary metabolism, and cell wall and surface functions. Furthermore, upregulated genes showed significant spatial structure across the A. fumigatus genome; they were more likely to occur in subtelomeric regions and colocalized in 27 genomic neighborhoods, many of which overlapped with known or candidate secondary metabolism gene clusters. We also identified 1,164 genes that were downregulated. This gene set was not spatially structured across the genome and was overrepresented in genes participating in primary metabolic functions, including carbon and amino acid metabolism. These results add valuable insight into the genetics of biofilm formation in A. fumigatus and other filamentous fungi and identify many relevant, in the context of biofilm biology, candidate genes for downstream functional experiments.},

abstract = {Dermatophytes and other filamentous fungi excrete sulphite as a reducing agent during keratin degradation. In the presence of sulphite, cystine in keratin is directly cleaved to cysteine and S-sulphocysteine, and thereby, reduced proteins become accessible to hydrolysis by a variety of secreted endo- and exoproteases. A gene encoding a sulphite transporter in Aspergillus fumigatus (AfuSSU1), and orthologues in the dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and Arthroderma benhamiae (TruSSU1 and AbeSSU1, respectively), were identified by functional expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Like the S. cerevisiae sulphite efflux pump Ssu1p, AfuSsu1p, TruSsu1p and AbeSsu1p belong to the tellurite-resistance/dicarboxylate transporter (TDT) family which includes the Escherichia coli tellurite transporter TehAp and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe malate transporter Mae1p. Seven genes in the A. fumigatus genome encode transporters of the TDT family. However, gene disruption of AfuSSU1 and of the two more closely related paralogues revealed that only AfuSSU1 encodes a sulphite efflux pump. TruSsulp and AbeSsulp are believed to be the first members of the TDT family identified in dermatophytes. The relatively high expression of TruSSU1 and AbeSSU1 in dermatophytes compared to that of AfuSSU1 in A. fumigatus likely reflects a property of dermatophytes which renders these fungi pathogenic. Sulphite transporters could be a new target for antifungal drugs in dermatology, since proteolytic digestion of hard keratin would not be possible without prior reduction of disulphide bridges.},

@article{Taff2012,
abstract = {Extracellular polysaccharides are key constituents of the biofilm matrix of many microorganisms. One critical carbohydrate component of Candida albicans biofilms, $\beta$-1,3 glucan, has been linked to biofilm protection from antifungal agents. In this study, we identify three glucan modification enzymes that function to deliver glucan from the cell to the extracellular matrix. These enzymes include two predicted glucan transferases and an exo-glucanase, encoded by BGL2, PHR1, and XOG1, respectively. We show that the enzymes are crucial for both delivery of $\beta$-1,3 glucan to the biofilm matrix and for accumulation of mature matrix biomass. The enzymes do not appear to impact cell wall glucan content of biofilm cells, nor are they necessary for filamentation or biofilm formation. We demonstrate that mutants lacking these genes exhibit enhanced susceptibility to the commonly used antifungal, fluconazole, during biofilm growth only. Transcriptional analysis and biofilm phenotypes of strains with multiple mutations suggest that these enzymes act in a complementary fashion to distribute matrix downstream of the primary $\beta$-1,3 glucan synthase encoded by FKS1. Furthermore, our observations suggest that this matrix delivery pathway works independently from the C. albicans ZAP1 matrix formation regulatory pathway. These glucan modification enzymes appear to play a biofilm-specific role in mediating the delivery and organization of mature biofilm matrix. We propose that the discovery of inhibitors for these enzymes would provide promising anti-biofilm therapeutics.},

To begin a genetic analysis of the initial synthetic steps leading to 1,8-DHN melanin biosynthesis, a 772-bp PCR product was amplified from genomic DNA using primers based on conserved regions of fungal polyketide synthases (Pks) known to produce the first cyclized 1,8-DHN-melanin pathway intermediate, 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene. The cloned PCR product was then used as a targeting sequence to disrupt the putative polyketide synthase gene, WdPKS1, in W. dermatitidis. The resultingwdpks1$\Delta$ disruptants showed no morphological defects other than an albino phenotype and grew at the same rate as their black wild-type parent. Using a marker rescue approach, the intactWdPKS1 gene was then successfully recovered from two plasmids. The WdPKS1 gene was also isolated independently by complementation of the mel3 mutation in an albino mutant of W. dermatitidis using a cosmid library. Sequence analysis substantiated that WdPKS1 encoded a putative polyketide synthase (WdPks1p) in a single open reading frame consisting of three exons separated by two short introns. This conclusion was supported by the identification of highly conserved Pks domains for a $\beta$-ketoacyl synthase, an acetyl-malonyl transferase, two acyl carrier proteins, and a thioesterase in the deduced amino acid sequence. Studies using a neutrophil killing assay and a mouse acute-infection model confirmed that all wdpks1$\Delta$ strains were less resistant to killing and less virulent, respectively, than their wild-type parent. Reconstitution of 1,8-DHN melanin biosynthesis in awdpks1$\Delta$ strain reestablished its resistance to killing by neutrophils and its ability to cause fatal mouse infections.},

abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, eight of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20{\%}-40{\%} of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {\textgreater}85{\%} for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {\textgreater}85{\%} for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same eight tools successfully control their false discovery rate for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining three tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that more than six biological replicates should be used, rising to more than 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If less than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makesedgeRthe leading tool. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important andDESeqmarginally outperforms the other tools.},

Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.},

abstract = {Clustering is the partitioning of a set of objects into groups (clusters) so that objects within a group are more similar to each others than objects in different groups. Most of the clustering algorithms depend on some assumptions in order to define the subgroups present in a data set. As a consequence, the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity. The evaluation procedure has to tackle difficult problems such as the quality of clusters, the degree with which a clustering scheme fits a specific data set and the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In the literature, a wide variety of indices have been proposed to find the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning of a data set during the clustering process. However, for most of indices proposed in the literature, programs are unavailable to test these indices and compare them. The R package NbClust has been developed for that purpose. It provides 30 indices which determine the number of clusters in a data set and it offers also the best clus- tering scheme from different results to the user. In addition, it provides a function to perform k-means and hierarchical clustering with different distance measures and aggre- gation methods. Any combination of validation indices and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call. This enables the user to simultaneously evaluate sev- eral clustering schemes while varying the number of clusters, to help determining the most appropriate number of clusters for the data set of interest.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: With improvements in next-generation sequencing technologies and reductions in price, ordered RNA-seq experiments are becoming common. Of primary interest in these experiments is identifying genes that are changing over time or space, for example, and then characterizing the specific expression changes. A number of robust statistical methods are available to identify genes showing differential expression among multiple conditions, but most assume conditions are exchangeable and thereby sacrifice power and precision when applied to ordered data.\n\nRESULTS: We propose an empirical Bayes mixture modeling approach called EBSeq-HMM. In EBSeq-HMM, an auto-regressive hidden Markov model is implemented to accommodate dependence in gene expression across ordered conditions. As demonstrated in simulation and case studies, the output proves useful in identifying differentially expressed genes and in specifying gene-specific expression paths. EBSeq-HMM may also be used for inference regarding isoform expression.\n\nAVAILABILITY: An R package containing examples and sample datasets is available at Bioconductor.\n\nCONTACT: kendzior@biostat.wisc.edu.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fungal genus Stachybotrys produces several diverse toxins that affect human health. Its strains comprise two mutually-exclusive toxin chemotypes, one producing satratoxins, which are a subclass of trichothecenes, and the other producing the less-toxic atranones. To determine the genetic basis for chemotype-specific differences in toxin production, the genomes of four Stachybotrys strains were sequenced and assembled de novo. Two of these strains produce atranones and two produce satratoxins. RESULTS: Comparative analysis of these four 35-Mbp genomes revealed several chemotype-specific gene clusters that are predicted to make secondary metabolites. The largest, which was named the core atranone cluster, encodes 14 proteins that may suffice to produce all observed atranone compounds via reactions that include an unusual Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Satratoxins are suggested to be made by products of multiple gene clusters that encode 21 proteins in all, including polyketide synthases, acetyltransferases, and other enzymes expected to modify the trichothecene skeleton. One such satratoxin chemotype-specific cluster is adjacent to the core trichothecene cluster, which has diverged from those of other trichothecene producers to contain a unique polyketide synthase. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that chemotype-specific gene clusters are likely the genetic basis for the mutually-exclusive toxin chemotypes of Stachybotrys. A unified biochemical model for Stachybotrys toxin production is presented. Overall, the four genomes described here will be useful for ongoing studies of this mold's diverse toxicity mechanisms.},

The distinct physiologies of yeast species provide a window into how genomes evolve in concert with niche. Although the enzymes of the well studied yeast galactose utilization pathway are present in all domains of life, we have found that multiple genes of the GAL pathway are absent from four yeast species that cannot use galactose. Whereas three species lack any trace of the pathway except a single gene, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, a close relative of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, retains remnants of all seven dedicated GAL genes as syntenic pseudogenes, providing a rare glimpse of an entire pathway in the process of degeneration. An estimate of the timing of gene inactivation suggests that pathway degeneration began early in the lineage and proceeded rapidly. S. kudriavzevii exhibits several other divergent physiological properties that are associated with a shift in ecological niche. These results suggest that rapid and irreversible gene inactivation and pathway degeneration are associated with adaptation to new ecological niches in natural populations. Inactivated genes may generally serve as markers of specific functions made dispensable by recent adaptive shifts.},

@article{Rawlings2014,
abstract = {Peptidases, their substrates and inhibitors are of great relevance to biology, medicine and biotechnology. The MEROPS database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk) aims to fulfill the need for an integrated source of information about these. The database has hierarchical classifications in which homologous sets of peptidases and protein inhibitors are grouped into protein species, which are grouped into families, which are in turn grouped into clans. Recent developments include the following. A community annotation project has been instigated in which acknowledged experts are invited to contribute summaries for peptidases. Software has been written to provide an Internet-based data entry form. Contributors are acknowledged on the relevant web page. A new display showing the intron/exon structures of eukaryote peptidase genes and the phasing of the junctions has been implemented. It is now possible to filter the list of peptidases from a completely sequenced bacterial genome for a particular strain of the organism. The MEROPS filing pipeline has been altered to circumvent the restrictions imposed on non-interactive blastp searches, and a HMMER search using specially generated alignments to maximize the distribution of organisms returned in the search results has been added.},
