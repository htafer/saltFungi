  abstract = "We summarize here results of studies designed to elucidate basic
              mechanisms of reactive oxygen (ROS)-mediated oxidation of
              proteins and free amino acids. These studies have shown that
              oxidation of proteins can lead to hydroxylation of aromatic
              groups and aliphatic amino acid side chains, nitration of
              aromatic amino acid residues, nitrosylation of sulfhydryl groups,
              sulfoxidation of methionine residues, chlorination of aromatic
              groups and primary amino groups, and to conversion of some amino
              acid residues to carbonyl derivatives. Oxidation can lead also to
              cleavage of the polypeptide chain and to formation of
              cross-linked protein aggregates. Furthermore, functional groups
              of proteins can react with oxidation products of polyunsaturated
              fatty acids and with carbohydrate derivatives
              (glycation/glycoxidation) to produce inactive derivatives. Highly
              specific methods have been developed for the detection and assay
              of the various kinds of protein modifications. Because the
              generation of carbonyl derivatives occurs by many different
              mechanisms, the level of carbonyl groups in proteins is widely
              used as a marker of oxidative protein damage. The level of
              oxidized proteins increases with aging and in a number of
              age-related diseases. However, the accumulation of oxidized
              protein is a complex function of the rates of ROS formation,
              antioxidant levels, and the ability to proteolytically eliminate
              oxidized forms of proteins. Thus, the accumulation of oxidized
              proteins is also dependent upon genetic factors and individual
              life styles. It is noteworthy that surface-exposed methionine and
              cysteine residues of proteins are particularly sensitive to
              oxidation by almost all forms of ROS; however, unlike other kinds
              of oxidation the oxidation of these sulfur-containing amino acid
              residues is reversible. It is thus evident that the cyclic
              oxidation and reduction of the sulfur-containing amino acids may
              serve as an important antioxidant mechanism, and also that these
              reversible oxidations may provide an important mechanism for the
              regulation of some enzyme functions.",

              external solutes via osmoregulated transporters. One insertion
              mutant out of 7,200 failed to accumulate the osmoprotectants
              ectoine and hydroxyectoine. Genetic analysis of the insertion
              site proved that the mutation affected an open reading frame
              (ORF) of 1,281 bp (teaC). The nucleotide sequence upstream of
              teaC was determined, and two further ORFs of 603 bp (teaB) and
              1,023 bp (teaA) were identified. Deletion of teaA and teaB proved
              that all three genes are mandatory for ectoine uptake. Sequence

              removal of hydrogen peroxide",
  author   = "Pannala, Venkat R and Dash, Ranjan K",
  abstract = "The thioredoxin system, which consists of a family of proteins,
              including thioredoxin (Trx), peroxiredoxin (Prx), and thioredoxin
              reductase (TrxR), plays a critical role in the defense against
              oxidative stress by removing harmful hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
              Specifically, Trx donates electrons to Prx to remove H2O2 and
              then TrxR maintains the reduced Trx concentration with NADPH as
              the cofactor. Despite a great deal of kinetic information
              gathered on the removal of H2O2 by the Trx system from various
              sources/species, a mechanistic understanding of the associated
              enzymes is still not available. We address this issue by
              developing a thermodynamically consistent mathematical model of
              the Trx system which entails mechanistic details and provides
              quantitative insights into the kinetics of the TrxR and Prx
              enzymes. Consistent with experimental studies, the model analyses
              of the available data show that both enzymes operate by a
              ping-pong mechanism. The proposed mechanism for TrxR, which
              incorporates substrate inhibition by NADPH and intermediate
              protonation states, well describes the available data and
              accurately predicts the bell-shaped behavior of the effect of pH
              on the TrxR activity. Most importantly, the model also predicts
              the inhibitory effects of the reaction products (NADP(+) and
              Trx(SH)2) on the TrxR activity for which suitable experimental
              data are not available. The model analyses of the available data
              on the kinetics of Prx from mammalian sources reveal that Prx
              operates at very low H2O2 concentrations compared to their human
              parasite counterparts. Furthermore, the model is able to predict
              the dynamic overoxidation of Prx at high H2O2 concentrations,
              consistent with the available data. The integrated Prx-TrxR model
              simulations well describe the NADPH and H2O2 degradation dynamics
              and also show that the coupling of TrxR- and Prx-dependent
              reduction of H2O2 allowed ultrasensitive changes in the Trx
              concentration in response to changes in the TrxR concentration at
              high Prx concentrations. Thus, the model of this sort is very
              useful for integration into computational H2O2 degradation models
              to identify its role in physiological and pathophysiological
              functions.",

              previously described the gene cut-1 of Neurospora crassa,
              encoding a protein of the haloacid dehalogenase family with an
              unknown function in the osmotic stress response. Here we report
              on the functional analysis of cutA, the orthologous gene in the
              phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium fujikuroi. cutA mRNA levels
              increased transiently after exposure to 0.68 M NaCl and were
              reduced upon return to normal osmotic conditions; deletion of the
              gene resulted in a partial reduction in tolerance to osmotic
              stress. $\Delta$cutA mutants contained much lower intracellular
              levels of glycerol than the wild-type, and did not exhibit the
              increase following hyper-osmotic shock expected from the high
              osmolarity glycerol (HOG) response. cutA is linked and
              divergently transcribed with the putative glycerol dehydrogenase
              gene gldB, which showed the same regulation by osmotic shock. The
              intergenic cutA/gldB regulatory region contains putative
              stress-response elements conserved in other fungi, and both genes
              shared other regulatory features, such as induction by heat shock
              and by illumination. Photoinduction was also observed in the HOG
              response gene hogA, and was lost in mutants of the white collar
              gene wcoA. Previous data on glycerol production in Aspergillus
              spp. and features of the predicted CutA protein lead us to
              propose that F. fujikuroi produces glycerol from
              dihydroxyacetone, and that CutA is the enzyme involved in the

              protection against environmental insults. For fungal pathogens,
              the cell wall is a key immunological modulator and an ideal
              therapeutic target. Yeast cell walls possess an inner matrix of
              interlinked $\beta$-glucan and chitin that is thought to provide
              tensile strength and rigidity. Yeast cells remodel their walls
              over time in response to environmental change, a process
              controlled by evolutionarily conserved stress (Hog1) and cell
              integrity (Mkc1, Cek1) signaling pathways. These
              mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways modulate cell
              wall gene expression, leading to the construction of a new,
              modified cell wall. We show that the cell wall is not rigid but
              elastic, displaying rapid structural realignments that impact
              survival following osmotic shock. Lactate-grown Candida albicans
              cells are more resistant to hyperosmotic shock than glucose-grown
              cells. We show that this elevated resistance is not dependent on
              Hog1 or Mkc1 signaling and that most cell death occurs within 10
              min of osmotic shock. Sudden decreases in cell volume drive rapid
              increases in cell wall thickness. The elevated stress resistance
              of lactate-grown cells correlates with reduced cell wall
              elasticity, reflected in slower changes in cell volume following
              hyperosmotic shock. The cell wall elasticity of lactate-grown
              cells is increased by a triple mutation that inactivates the Crh
              family of cell wall cross-linking enzymes, leading to increased
              sensitivity to hyperosmotic shock. Overexpressing Crh family
              members in glucose-grown cells reduces cell wall elasticity,
              providing partial protection against hyperosmotic shock. These
              changes correlate with structural realignment of the cell wall
              and with the ability of cells to withstand osmotic shock.
              IMPORTANCE: The C. albicans cell wall is the first line of
              defense against external insults, the site of immune recognition
              by the host, and an attractive target for antifungal therapy. Its
              tensile strength is conferred by a network of cell wall
              polysaccharides, which are remodeled in response to growth
              conditions and environmental stress. However, little is known
              about how cell wall elasticity is regulated and how it affects
              adaptation to stresses such as sudden changes in osmolarity. We
              show that elasticity is critical for survival under conditions of
              osmotic shock, before stress signaling pathways have time to
              induce gene expression and drive glycerol accumulation. Critical
              cell wall remodeling enzymes control cell wall flexibility, and
              its regulation is strongly dependent on host nutritional inputs.
              We also demonstrate an entirely new level of cell wall dynamism,
              where significant architectural changes and structural
              realignment occur within seconds of an osmotic shock.",

              serpentine receptors, which control important functions such as
              taste, vision, blood pressure, body weight, cell proliferation,
              mood, etc. Moreover, the exchange of GDP by GTP is triggered by
              nucleotide exchange factors. Membrane receptors that activate G
              proteins can be considered as such, but other cytosolic,
              membranal or amphitropic proteins can accelerate the rate of G
              protein exchange or even activate this process in the absence of
              receptor-mediated activation. These and other protein-protein
              interactions of G proteins with other signaling proteins are
              regulated by their lipid preferences. Thus, G protein-lipid
              interactions control the features of messages and cell

  abstract = "The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans causes lethal systemic
              infections because of its ability to grow and disseminate in a
              host. The C. albicans plasma membrane is essential for virulence
              by acting as a protective barrier and through its key roles in
              interfacing with the environment, secretion of virulence factors,
              morphogenesis, and cell wall synthesis. Difficulties in studying
              hydrophobic membranes have limited the understanding of how
              plasma membrane organization contributes to its function and to
              the actions of antifungal drugs. Therefore, the role of the
              recently discovered plasma membrane subdomains termed the
              membrane compartment containing Can1 (MCC) was analyzed by
              assessing the virulence of a sur7$\Delta$ mutant. Sur7 is an
              integral membrane protein component of the MCC that is needed for
              proper localization of actin, morphogenesis, cell wall synthesis,
              and responding to cell wall stress. MCC domains are stable
              300-nm-sized punctate patches that associate with a complex of
              cytoplasmic proteins known as an eisosome. Analysis of
              virulence-related properties of a sur7$\Delta$ mutant revealed
              defects in intraphagosomal growth in macrophages that correlate
              with increased sensitivity to oxidation and copper. The
              sur7$\Delta$ mutant was also strongly defective in pathogenesis
              in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. The mutant cells showed
              a decreased ability to initiate an infection and greatly
              diminished invasive growth into kidney tissues. These studies on
              Sur7 demonstrate that the plasma membrane MCC domains are
              critical for virulence and represent an important new target for
              the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
              IMPORTANCECandida albicans, the most common human fungal
              pathogen, causes lethal systemic infections by growing and
              disseminating in a host. The plasma membrane plays key roles in
              enabling C. albicans to grow in vivo, and it is also the target
              of the most commonly used antifungal drugs. However, plasma
              membrane organization is poorly understood because of the
              experimental difficulties in studying hydrophobic components.
              Interestingly, recent studies have identified a novel type of
              plasma membrane subdomain in fungi known as the membrane
              compartment containing Can1 (MCC). Cells lacking the
              MCC-localized protein Sur7 display broad defects in cellular
              organization and response to stress in vitro. Consistent with
              this, C. albicans cells lacking the SUR7 gene were more
              susceptible to attack by macrophages than cells with the gene and
              showed greatly reduced virulence in a mouse model of systemic
              infection. Thus, Sur7 and other MCC components represent novel
              targets for antifungal therapy.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In the last years, the biotechnological production of
              platform chemicals for fuel components has become a major focus
              of interest. Although ligno-cellulosic material is considered as
              suitable feedstock, the almost inevitable pretreatment of this
              recalcitrant material may interfere with the subsequent
              fermentation steps. In this study, the fungus Ustilago maydis was
              used to produce itaconic acid as platform chemical for the
              synthesis of potential biofuels such as 3-methyltetrahydrofuran.
              No studies, however, have investigated how pretreatment of
              ligno-cellulosic biomass precisely influences the subsequent
              fermentation by U. maydis. Thus, this current study aims to first
              characterize U. maydis in shake flasks and then to evaluate the
              influence of three exemplary pretreatment methods on the
              cultivation and itaconic acid production of this fungus.
              Cellulose enzymatically hydrolysed in seawater and salt-assisted
              organic-acid catalysed cellulose were investigated as substrates.
              Lastly, hydrolysed hemicellulose from fractionated beech wood was
              applied as substrate. RESULTS: U. maydis was characterized on
              shake flask level regarding its itaconic acid production on
              glucose. Nitrogen limitation was shown to be a crucial condition
              for the production of itaconic acid. For itaconic acid
              concentrations above 25 g/L, a significant product inhibition was
              observed. Performing experiments that simulated influences of
              possible pretreatment methods, U. maydis was only slightly
              affected by high osmolarities up to 3.5 osmol/L as well as of 0.1
              M oxalic acid. The production of itaconic acid was achieved on
              pretreated cellulose in seawater and on the hydrolysed
              hemicellulosic fraction of pretreated beech wood. CONCLUSION: The
              fungus U. maydis is a promising producer of itaconic acid, since
              it grows as single cells (yeast-like) in submerged cultivations
              and it is extremely robust in high osmotic media and real
              seawater. Moreover, U. maydis can grow on the hemicellulosic
              fraction of pretreated beech wood. Thereby, this fungus combines
              important advantages of yeasts and filamentous fungi.
              Nevertheless, the biomass pretreatment does indeed affect the
              subsequent itaconic acid production. Although U. maydis is
              insusceptible to most possible impurities from pretreatment, high
              amounts of salts or residues of organic acids can slow microbial
              growth and decrease the production. Consequently, the
              pretreatment step needs to fit the prerequisites defined by the
              actual microorganisms applied for fermentation.",

              plants. Although the function(s) of these proteins are mostly
              unknown, they have been linked to various, often unrelated
              cellular processes such as those connected to mitochondrial and
              cell wall functions. Here we show that three of the four
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUN family proteins, Uth1p, Sim1p and
              Sun4p, are efficiently secreted out of the cells in different
              growth phases and their production is affected by the level of
              oxygen. The Uth1p, Sim1p, Sun4p and Nca3p are mostly synthesized
              during the growth phase of both yeast liquid cultures and
              colonies. Culture transition to slow-growing or stationary phases
              is linked with a decreased cellular concentration of Sim1p and
              Sun4p and with their efficient release from the cells. In
              contrast, Uth1p is released mainly from growing cells. The
              synthesis of Uth1p and Sim1p, but not of Sun4p, is repressed by
              anoxia. All four proteins confer cell sensitivity to zymolyase.
              In addition, Uth1p affects cell sensitivity to compounds
              influencing cell wall composition and integrity (such as
              Calcofluor white and Congo red) differently when growing on
              fermentative versus respiratory carbon sources. In contrast,
              Uth1p is essential for cell resistance to boric acids

              support the hypothesis that SUN family proteins are involved in
              the remodeling of the yeast cell wall during the various phases
              of yeast culture development and under various environmental
              conditions. The finding that Uth1p is involved in cell
              sensitivity to boric acid, i.e. to a compound that is commonly

              response as well as accumulation of glycogen stores. Previous
              studies have suggested that the PKA effects on the two latter
              processes result in part from transcription repression. Here we
              show that transcription derepression that accompanies PKA
              depletion is dependent upon the presence of two redundant
              Zn2+-finger transcription factors, Msn2p and Msn4p. The Msn2p and
              Msn4p proteins were shown previously to act as positive
              transcriptional factors in the stress response pathway, and our
              results suggest that Msn2p and Msn4p also mediate PKA-dependent
              effects on stress response as well as glycogen accumulation
              genes. Interestingly, PKA activity is dispensable in a strain
              lacking Msn2p and Msn4p activity. Thus, Msn2p and Msn4p may
              antagonize PKAdependent growth by stimulating expression of genes
              that inhibit growth. In agreement with this model, Msn2p/Msn4p
              function is required for expression of a gene, YAK1, previously
              shown to antagonize PKA-dependent growth. These results suggest
              that Msn2p/Msn4p-dependent gene expression may account for all,
              or at least most, of the pleiotropic effects of yeast PKA,

              Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates the HOG1 mitogen-activated
              protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is composed of a pair of
              redundant MAPK kinase kinases, namely, Ssk2p and Ssk22p, the MAPK
              kinase Pbs2p, and the MAPK Hog1p. Hog1p is activated by Pbs2p
              through phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine
              residues. Activated Hog1p is essential for survival of yeast
              cells at high osmolarity. However, expression of constitutively
              active mutant kinases, such as those encoded by SSK2deltaN and
              PBS2(DD), is toxic and results in a lethal level of Hog1p
              activation. Overexpression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase
              Ptp2p suppresses the lethality of these mutations by
              dephosphorylating Hog1p. A catalytically inactive Cys-to-Ser
              Ptp2p mutant (Ptp2(C/S)p) is tightly bound to
              tyrosine-phosphorylated Hog1p in vivo. Disruption of PTP2 leads
              to elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated Hog1p following
              exposure of cells to high osmolarity. Disruption of both PTP2 and
              another protein tyrosine phosphatase gene, PTP3, results in
              constitutive Hog1p tyrosine phosphorylation even in the absence
              of increased osmolarity. Thus, Ptp2p and Ptp3p are the major
              phosphatases responsible for the tyrosine dephosphorylation of
              Hog1p. When catalytically inactive Hog1(K/N)p is expressed in
              hog1delta cells, it is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. In
              contrast, Hog1(K/N)p, expressed together with wild-type Hog1p, is
              tyrosine phosphorylated only when cells are exposed to high
              osmolarity. Thus, the kinase activity of Hog1p is required for
              its own tyrosine dephosphorylation. Northern blot analyses
              suggest that Hog1p regulates Ptp2p and/or Ptp3p activity at the
              posttranscriptional level.",

              Here, we provide further evidence to support a negative role of
              AtGSTU17 in drought and salt stress tolerance. When AtGSTU17 was
              mutated, plants were more tolerant to drought and salt stresses
              compared with wild-type plants. In addition, atgstu17 accumulated
              higher levels of GSH and abscisic acid (ABA) and exhibited
              hyposensitivity to ABA during seed germination, smaller stomatal

              primary and lateral root systems, and longer vegetative growth.
              To explore how atgstu17 accumulated higher ABA content, we grew

              they accumulated ABA to a higher extent than plants grown in the

              Wild-type plants treated with GSH also demonstrated more

They were first reported in 2000 to be active inhabitants of hypersaline environments, when they were found in man-made solar salterns in Slovenia. Since then, they have been described in different salterns and salt lakes on three continents. The mycobiota that inhabit these natural hypersaline environments are composed of phylogenetically unrelated halotolerant, extremely halotolerant, and halophilic fungi, which are represented not only by species previously known only as food contaminants, but also by new and rare species. The dominant representatives are different species of black yeast-like and related melanized fungi of the genus Cladosporium, different species within the anamorphic Aspergillus and Penicillium, and the teleomorphic Emericella and Eurotium, certain species of non-melanized yeasts, and Wallemia spp. Until the discovery and description of indigenous saltern mycobiota, the physiological and molecular mechanisms related to salt tolerance in eukaryotic microorganisms were studied using salt-sensitive model organisms. The most studied eukaryotic microorganism was Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which cannot adapt to hypersaline conditions. Species like Debaryomyces hansenii, Aureobasidum pullulans, Hortaea werneckii and Wallemia ichthyophaga, which have now been isolated globally from natural hypersaline environments, represent more suitable model organisms for the study of halotolerance in eukaryotes. Such studies in these species, and particularly with the extremely halotolerant H. werneckii and obligately halophilic W. ichthyophaga have continued to unravel the different strategies that these microorganisms can use to cope with the problems of ion toxicity and low water activity. The focus of this review is to present the main species of fungi inhabiting solar salterns around the world and the most suitable model fungi to study adaptations to life at high salinity},

              activity of a salt-dependent glycerol uptake similar to that
              described in the literature for Debraryomyces hansenii. The
              strains within the two lower classes of salt tolerance showed, to
              varying degrees, glycerol active uptake only when glycerol was
              used as the carbon and energy source, suggesting that this uptake
              system is involved in glycerol catabolism. The results within
              this work suggest that active glycerol uptake provides a basis
              for high halotolerance, helping to maintain a favourable
              intracellular concentration of glycerol. The relation between the
              constitutive expression of such carriers and a higher level of
              salt-stress resistance suggests that this may be an evolutionary
              advantage for growth under such conditions.",

              have until recently been limited to the baker's yeast
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a few other moderately halotolerant
              yeast. Discovery of the extremely halotolerant and adaptable
              fungus Hortaea werneckii and the obligate halophile Wallemia
              ichthyophaga introduced two new model organisms into studies on
              the mechanisms of salt tolerance in eukaryotes. H. werneckii is
              unique in its adaptability to fluctuations in salt
              concentrations, as it can grow without NaCl as well as in the
              presence of up to 5 M NaCl. On the other hand, W. ichthyophaga
              requires at least 1.5 M NaCl for growth, but also grows in up to
              5 M NaCl. Our studies have revealed the novel and intricate
              molecular mechanisms used by these fungi to combat high salt
              concentrations, which differ in many aspects between the
              extremely halotolerant H. werneckii and the halophilic W.
              ichthyophaga. Specifically, the high osmolarity glycerol
              signaling pathway that is important for sensing and responding to
              increased salt concentrations is here compared between H.
              werneckii and W. ichthyophaga. In both of these fungi, the key
              signaling components are conserved, but there are structural and
              regulation differences between these pathways in H. werneckii and
              W. ichthyophaga. We also address differences that have been
              revealed from analysis of their newly sequenced genomes. The most
              striking characteristics associated with H. werneckii are the
              large genetic redundancy, the expansion of genes encoding metal
              cation transporters, and a relatively recent whole genome
              duplication. In contrast, the genome of W. ichthyophaga is very
              compact, as only 4884 protein-coding genes are predicted, which
              cover almost three quarters of the sequence. Importantly, there
              has been a significant increase in their hydrophobins, cell-wall
              proteins that have multiple cellular functions.",

              The fungus Eurotium rubrum (Eurotiomycetes) is among the few
              species able to survive there. Here we highlight its adaptive
              strategies, based on genome analysis and transcriptome profiling.
              The 26.2 Mb genome of E. rubrum shows, for example, gains in gene
              families related to stress response and losses with regard to
              transport processes. Transcriptome analyses under different salt
              growth conditions revealed, among other things differentially
              expressed genes encoding ion and metabolite transporters. Our
              findings suggest that long-term adaptation to salinity requires
              cellular and metabolic responses that differ from short-term
              osmotic stress signalling. The transcriptional response indicates
              that halophilic E. rubrum actively counteracts the salinity
              stress. Many of its genes encode for proteins with a
              significantly higher proportion of acidic amino acid residues.
              This trait is characteristic of the halophilic prokaryotes as
              well, supporting the theory of convergent evolution under extreme

              means to add a temporal dimension to the Tree of Life.
              Increasingly larger datasets encompassing greater taxonomic
              diversity are becoming available to generate molecular timetrees
              by using sophisticated methods that model rate variation among
              lineages. However, the practical application of these methods is
              challenging because of the exorbitant calculation times required
              by current methods for contemporary data sizes, the difficulty in
              correctly modeling the rate heterogeneity in highly diverse
              taxonomic groups, and the lack of reliable clock calibrations and
              their uncertainty distributions for most groups of species. Here,
              we present a method that estimates relative times of divergences
              for all branching points (nodes) in very large phylogenetic trees
              without assuming a specific model for lineage rate variation or
              specifying any clock calibrations. The method (RelTime) performed
              better than existing methods when applied to very large computer
              simulated datasets where evolutionary rates were varied
              extensively among lineages by following autocorrelated and
              uncorrelated models. On average, RelTime completed calculations
              1,000 times faster than the fastest Bayesian method, with even
              greater speed difference for larger number of sequences. This
              speed and accuracy will enable molecular dating analysis of very
              large datasets. Relative time estimates will be useful for
              determining the relative ordering and spacing of speciation
              events, identifying lineages with significantly slower or faster
              evolutionary rates, diagnosing the effect of selected
              calibrations on absolute divergence times, and estimating

              a strict molecular clock in a phylogeny. It shows excellent
              performance in estimating divergence times for both simulated and
              empirical molecular sequence data sets in which evolutionary
              rates varied extensively throughout the tree. RelTime is
              computationally efficient and scales well with increasing size of
              data sets. Until now, however, RelTime has not had a formal
              mathematical foundation. Here, we show that the basis of the
              RelTime approach is a relative rate framework (RRF) that combines
              comparisons of evolutionary rates in sister lineages with the
              principle of minimum rate change between evolutionary lineages
              and their respective descendants. We present analytical solutions

              RRF. We also discuss the relationship of RRF with other
              approaches, including the Bayesian framework. We conclude that
              RelTime will be useful for phylogenies with branch lengths

              Molecular dating has enhanced our understanding of the temporal
              patterns of species divergences over the last five decades, and
              the number of studies is increasing quickly due to an exponential
              growth in the available collection of molecular sequences from
              diverse species and large number of genes. Our TimeTree resource
              is a public knowledge-base with the primary focus to make
              available all species divergence times derived using molecular
              sequence data to scientists, educators, and the general public in
              a consistent and accessible format. Here, we report a major
              expansion of the TimeTree resource, which more than triples the
              number of species (>97,000) and more than triples the number of

              not only the divergence time between two species or higher taxa,

              traces a species' evolution through time. The new timetree and

              overall annotation coverage from 67\% to 72\%. The functional
              annotations of OGs have been expanded to also provide Gene
              Ontology terms, KEGG pathways and SMART/Pfam domains for each
              group. Moreover, eggNOG now provides pairwise orthology
              relationships within OGs based on analysis of phylogenetic trees.
              We have also incorporated a framework for quickly mapping novel
              sequences to OGs based on precomputed HMM profiles. Finally,
              eggNOG version 4.5 incorporates a novel data set spanning 2605
              viral OGs, covering 5228 proteins from 352 viral proteomes. All
              data are accessible for bulk downloading, as a web-service, and
              through a completely redesigned web interface. The new access
              points provide faster searches and a number of new browsing and
              visualization capabilities, facilitating the needs of both
              experts and less experienced users. eggNOG v4.5 is available at

              programmable visualization and annotation of phylogenetic trees.
              ggtree can read more tree file formats than other softwares,
              including newick, nexus, NHX, phylip and jplace formats, and
              support visualization of phylo, multiphylo, phylo4, phylo4d,
              obkdata and phyloseq tree objects defined in other r packages. It
              can also extract the tree/branch/node-specific and other data
              from the analysis outputs of beast, epa, hyphy, paml, phylodog,
              pplacer, r8s, raxml and revbayes software, and allows using these
              data to annotate the tree. The package allows colouring and
              annotation of a tree by numerical/categorical node attributes,
              manipulating a tree by rotating, collapsing and zooming out
              clades, highlighting user selected clades or operational
              taxonomic units and exploration of a large tree by zooming into a
              selected portion. A two-dimensional tree can be drawn by scaling
              the tree width based on an attribute of the nodes. A tree can be
              annotated with an associated numerical matrix (as a heat map),
              multiple sequence alignment, subplots or silhouette images. The
              package ggtree is released under the artistic-2.0 license. The

              interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative

  abstract = "High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively
              to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic
              studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the
              transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a
              first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for
              abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest,
              such as genes or transcripts. Several different quantification
              approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of
              reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex
              estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we
              show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical
              inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in
              terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate
              that while the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to
              inflated false discovery rates in differential expression
              analyses on simple count matrices and transcript-level abundance
              estimates improve the performance in simulated data, the
              difference is relatively minor in several real data sets.
              Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport ) to help users
              integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common
              quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference

  abstract = "A gene from Magnaporthe grisea was cloned using a cDNA clone of
              the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides cutinase gene as a
              heterologous probe; the nucleotide sequence of a 2 kb DNA segment
              containing the gene has been determined. DNA hybridization
              analysis shows that the M. grisea genome contains only one copy
              of this gene. The predicted polypeptide contains 228 amino acids
              and is homologous to the three previously characterized
              cutinases, showing 74\% amino acid similarity to the cutinase of
              C. gloeosporioides. Comparison with previously determined
              cutinase sequences suggests that the gene contains two introns,
              115 and 147 bp in length. The gene is expressed when cutin is the
              sole carbon source but not when the carbon source is cutin and
              glucose together or glucose alone. Levels of intracellular and
              extracellular cutinase activity increase in response to growth in
              the presence of cutin. The activity level is higher in a
              transformant containing multiple copies of the cloned gene than
              in the parent strain. Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels stained
              for esterase activity show a single major band among
              intracellular and extracellular proteins from cutin-grown
              cultures that is not present among intracellular and
              extracellular proteins prepared from glucose-grown or
              carbon-starved cultures. This band stains more intensely in
              extracts from the multicopy transformant than in extracts from
              the parent strain. We conclude that the cloned DNA contains a M.

  abstract = "We present a new approach to automatic training of a eukaryotic
              ab initio gene finding algorithm. With the advent of
              Next-Generation Sequencing, automatic training has become
              paramount, allowing genome annotation pipelines to keep pace with
              the speed of genome sequencing. Earlier we developed GeneMark-ES,
              currently the only gene finding algorithm for eukaryotic genomes
              that performs automatic training in unsupervised ab initio mode.
              The new algorithm, GeneMark-ET augments GeneMark-ES with a novel
              method that integrates RNA-Seq read alignments into the
              self-training procedure. Use of 'assembled' RNA-Seq transcripts
              is far from trivial; significant error rate of assembly was
              revealed in recent assessments. We demonstrated in computational
              experiments that the proposed method of incorporation of
              'unassembled' RNA-Seq reads improves the accuracy of gene
              prediction; particularly, for the 1.3 GB genome of Aedes aegypti
              the mean value of prediction Sensitivity and Specificity at the

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Gene finding in eukaryotic genomes is notoriously
              difficult to automate. The task is to design a work flow with a
              minimal set of tools that would reach state-of-the-art
              performance across a wide range of species. GeneMark-ET is a gene
              prediction tool that incorporates RNA-Seq data into unsupervised
              training and subsequently generates ab initio gene predictions.
              AUGUSTUS is a gene finder that usually requires supervised
              training and uses information from RNA-Seq reads in the
              prediction step. Complementary strengths of GeneMark-ET and
              AUGUSTUS provided motivation for designing a new combined tool
              for automatic gene prediction. RESULTS: We present BRAKER1, a
              pipeline for unsupervised RNA-Seq-based genome annotation that
              combines the advantages of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS. As input,
              BRAKER1 requires a genome assembly file and a file in bam-format
              with spliced alignments of RNA-Seq reads to the genome. First,
              GeneMark-ET performs iterative training and generates initial
              gene structures. Second, AUGUSTUS uses predicted genes for
              training and then integrates RNA-Seq read information into final
              gene predictions. In our experiments, we observed that BRAKER1
              was more accurate than MAKER2 when it is using RNA-Seq as sole
              source for training and prediction. BRAKER1 does not require
              pre-trained parameters or a separate expert-prepared training

              based on a Generalized Hidden Markov Model, a probabilistic model
              of a sequence and its gene structure. Like most existing gene
              finders, the first version of AUGUSTUS returned one transcript
              per predicted gene and ignored the phenomenon of alternative
              splicing. Herein, we present a WWW server for an extended version
              of AUGUSTUS that is able to predict multiple splice variants. To
              our knowledge, this is the first ab initio gene finder that can
              predict multiple transcripts. In addition, we offer a motif
              searching facility, where user-defined regular expressions can be
              searched against putative proteins encoded by the predicted
              genes. The AUGUSTUS web interface and the downloadable
              open-source stand-alone program are freely available from
              http://augustus.gobics.de.",

              is present at low concentration in the environment. In addition,
              sodium improves growth and protects D. hansenii in the presence
              of additional stress factors such as high temperature and extreme
              pH. An array of advantageous factors, as compared with
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is putatively involved in the increased
              halotolerance of D. hansenii: glycerol, the main compatible
              solute, is kept inside the cell by an active glycerol-Na+
              symporter; potassium uptake is not inhibited by sodium; sodium

              phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade support of phylogenetic
              trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this
              task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation
              methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the
              Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have
              been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an
              ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute
              the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML)
              based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated
              log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection
              scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that
              assesses the convergence of branch support values to
              automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees.
              UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66-33.3) to
              10.2 (range: 1.32-41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and
              amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive
              simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model
              violations and the support values obtained appear to be
              relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard
              bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the
              bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software
              (available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree) to perform the

              methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast
              programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal
              trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus,
              there is need for additional approaches that employ different
              search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time
              as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a
              combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic
              perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we
              allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software
              IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2\% and 87.1\% of the
              studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If

              an external osmolarity that is higher than the physiological
              range, can be a matter of life or death for all cells. It is
              especially important for free-living organisms such as the yeast
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When exposed to hyperosmotic stress,
              the yeast initiates a complex adaptive program that includes
              temporary arrest of cell-cycle progression, adjustment of
              transcription and translation patterns, and the synthesis and
              retention of the compatible osmolyte glycerol. These adaptive
              responses are mostly governed by the high osmolarity glycerol
              (HOG) pathway, which is composed of membrane-associated
              osmosensors, an intracellular signaling pathway whose core is the
              Hog1 MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade, and cytoplasmic and nuclear
              effector functions. The entire pathway is conserved in diverse
              fungal species, while the Hog1 MAPK cascade is conserved even in
              higher eukaryotes including humans. This conservation is
              illustrated by the fact that the mammalian stress-responsive p38
              MAPK can rescue the osmosensitivity of hog1$\Delta$ mutations in
              response to hyperosmotic challenge. As the HOG pathway is one of
              the best-understood eukaryotic signal transduction pathways, it
              is useful not only as a model for analysis of osmostress
              responses, but also as a model for mathematical analysis of
              signal transduction pathways. In this review, we have summarized

              cells to increases in extracellular osmolarity activates the HOG1
              MAP kinase cascade, which is composed of three tiers of protein
              kinases, namely the SSK2, SSK22 and STE11 MAPKKKs, the PBS2
              MAPKK, and the HOG1 MAPK. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)
              fusions of these kinases, we found that HOG1, PBS2 and STE11
              localize to the cytoplasm of unstressed cells. Following osmotic
              stress, HOG1, but neither PBS2 nor STE11, translocates into the

              obligate intracellular lifestyle and adaptation to soil habitat",
  author   = "Stepkowski, T and Legocki, A B",
  abstract = "Prokaryotic organisms are exposed in the course of evolution to
              various impacts, resulting often in drastic changes of their
              genome size. Depending on circumstances, the same lineage may
              diverge into species having substantially reduced genomes, or
              such whose genomes have undergone considerable enlargement.
              Genome reduction is a consequence of obligate intracellular
              lifestyle rendering numerous genes expendable. Another
              consequence of intracellular lifestyle is reduction of effective
              population size and limited possibility of gene acquirement via
              lateral transfer. This causes a state of relaxed selection
              resulting in accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations that
              can not be corrected by recombination with the wild type copy.
              Thus, gene loss is usually irreversible. Additionally, constant
              environment of the eukaryotic cell renders that some bacterial
              genes involved in DNA repair are expandable. The loss of these
              genes is a probable cause of mutational bias resulting in a high
              A+T content. While causes of genome reduction are rather
              indisputable, those resulting in genome expansion seem to be less
              obvious. Presumably, the genome enlargement is an indirect
              consequence of adaptation to changing environmental conditions
              and requires the acquisition and integration of numerous genes.
              It seems that the need for a great number of capabilities is
              common among soil bacteria irrespective of their phylogenetic
              relationship. However, this would not be possible if soil
              bacteria lacked indigenous abilities to exchange and accumulate
              genetic information. The latter are considerably facilitated when
              housekeeping genes are physically separated from adaptive loci
              which are useful only in certain circumstances.",

              Overexpression of yeast IMPases increased lithium and sodium

  abstract = "Background: Chloroperoxidase (CPO) is a versatile heme-containing
              enzyme that exhibits peroxidase, catalase and cytochrome
              P450-like activities in addition to catalyzing halogenation
              reactions. The structure determination of CPO was undertaken to
              help elucidate those structural features that enable the enzyme
              to exhibit these multiple activities. Results Despite functional
              similarities with other heme enzymes, CPO folds into a novel
              tertiary structure dominated by eight helical segments. The
              catalytic base, required to cleave the peroxide O--O bond, is
              glutamic acid rather than histidine as in other peroxidases. CPO
              contains a hydrophobic patch above the heme that could be the
              binding site for substrates that undergo P450-like reactions. The
              crystal structure also shows extensive glycosylation with both N-
              and O-linked glycosyl chains. Conclusion The proximal side of the
              heme in CPO resembles cytochrome P450 because a cysteine residue
              serves as an axial heme ligand, whereas the distal side of the
              heme is `peroxidase-like' in that polar residues form the
              peroxide-binding site. Access to the heme pocket is restricted to
              the distal face such that small organic substrates can interact
              with an iron-linked oxygen atom which accounts for the P450-like
              reactions catalyzed by chloroperoxidase.",

              The routes for the biosynthesis of these solutes and their
              regulation were examined. The genome contains two genes
              potentially encoding glutamate dehydrogenases and two genes for
              the small subunit of a glutamate synthase, but only one gene for
              the large subunit. However, the expression of these genes was not
              salt dependent, nor were the corresponding enzymatic activities
              detectable in cell extracts of cells grown at different

              readily detectable in H. halophilus. Induction of glutamine
              synthetase activity was strictly salt dependent and reached a
              maximum at 3.0 M NaCl; chloride stimulated the production of
              active enzyme by about 300\%. Two potential genes encoding a

  author   = "Shelest, Ekaterina",
  abstract = "Transcription factors (TFs) are essential regulators of gene
              expression in a cell; the entire repertoire of TFs (TFome) of a
              species reflects its regulatory potential and the evolutionary
              history of the regulatory mechanisms. In this work, I give an
              overview of fungal TFs, analyze TFome dynamics, and discuss TF
              families and types of particular interest. Whole-genome
              annotation of TFs in more than 200 fungal species revealed ~80
              families of TFs that are typically found in fungi. Almost half of
              the considered genomes belonged to basidiomycetes and
              zygomycetes, which have been underrepresented in earlier
              annotations due to dearth of sequenced genomes. The TFomes were
              analyzed in terms of expansion strategies genome- and
              lineage-wise. Generally, TFomes are known to correlate with
              genome size; but what happens to particular families when a TFome
              is expanding? By dissecting TFomes into single families and
              estimating the impact of each of them, I show that in fungi the
              TFome increment is largely limited to three families (C6 Zn
              clusters, C2H2-like Zn fingers, and homeodomain-like). To see
              whether this is a fungal peculiarity or a ubiquitous eukaryotic
              feature, I also analyzed metazoan TFomes, where I observed a
              similar trend (limited number of TFome-shaping families) but also
              some important differences connected mostly with the increased
              complexity in animals. The expansion strategies of TF families
              are lineage-specific; I demonstrate how the patterns of the TF
              families' distributions, designated as ``TF signatures,'' can be
              used as a taxonomic feature, e.g., for allocation of uncertain
              phyla. In addition, both fungal and metazoan genomes contain an
              intriguing type of TFs. While usually TFs have a single
              DNA-binding domain, these TFs possess two (or more) different
              DNA-binding specificities. I demonstrate that dual-specific TFs
              comprising various combinations of all major TF families are a
              typical feature of fungal and animal genomes and have an
              interesting evolutionary history involving gene duplications and

abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae FPS1 gene, which encodes a channel protein belonging to the MIP family, has been isolated previously as a multicopy suppressor of the growth defect of the fdp1 mutant (allelic to GGS1/TPS1) on fermentable sugars. Here we show that overexpression of FPS1 enhances glycerol production. Enhanced glycerol production caused by overexpression of GPD1 encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase also suppressed the growth defect of ggs1/tps1 delta mutants, suggesting a novel role for glycerol production in the control of glycolysis. The suppression of ggs1/tps1 delta mutants by GPD1 depends on the presence of Fps1. Mutants lacking Fps1 accumulate a greater part of the glycerol intracellularly, indicating that Fps1 is involved in glycerol efflux. Glycerol-uptake experiments showed that the permeability of the yeast plasma membrane for glycerol consists of an Fps1-independent component probably due to simple diffusion and of an Fps1-dependent component representing facilitated diffusion. The Escherichia coli glycerol facilitator expressed in a yeast fps1 delta mutant can restore the characteristics of glycerol uptake, production and distribution fully, but restores only partially growth of a ggs1/tps1 delta fps1 delta double mutant on glucose. Fps1 appears to be closed under hyperosmotic stress when survival depends on intracellular accumulation of glycerol and apparently opens rapidly when osmostress is lifted. The osmostress-induced High Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) response pathway is not required for inactivation of Fps1. We conclude that Fps1 is a regulated yeast glycerol facilitator controlling glycerol production and cytosolic concentration, and might have additional functions.},

abstract = {Background The prosperity of Hallstatt (Salzkammergut region, Austria) is based on the richness of salt in the surrounding mountains and salt mining, which is documented as far back as 1500 years B.C. Substantial archaeological evidence of Bronze and Iron Age salt mining has been discovered, with a wooden staircase (1108 B.C.) being one of the most impressive and well preserved finds. However, after its discovery, fungal mycelia have been observed on the surface of the staircase, most probably due to airborne contamination after its find.   Objective As a basis for the further preservation of this valuable object, the active micro-flora was examined to investigate the presence of potentially biodegradative microorganisms.   Results Most of the strains isolated from the staircase showed to be halotolerant and halophilic microorganisms, due to the saline environment of the mine. Results derived from culture-dependent assays revealed a high fungal diversity, including both halotolerant and halophilic fungi, the most dominant strains being members of the genus Phialosimplex (synonym: Aspergillus). Additionally, some typical cellulose degraders, namely Stachybotrys sp. and Cladosporium sp. were detected. Numerous bacterial strains were isolated and identified as members of 12 different genera, most of them being moderately halophilic species. The most dominant isolates affiliated with species of the genera Halovibrio and Marinococcus. Halophilic archaea were also isolated and identified as species of the genera Halococcus and Halorubrum. Molecular analyses complemented the cultivation assays, enabling the identification of some uncultivable archaea of the genera Halolamina, Haloplanus and Halobacterium. Results derived from fungi and bacteria supported those obtained by cultivation methods, exhibiting the same dominant members in the communities.   Conclusion The results clearly showed the presence of some cellulose degraders that may become active if the requirements for growth and the environmental conditions turn suitable; therefore, these microorganisms must be regarded as a threat to the wood.},

Species delimitation methods based on multispecies coalescent model were employed on DNA sequences from four loci, i.e., ID region of rDNA (ITS + 28S), CaM, benA and RPB2, and supported recognition of 21 species, including 14 new. All these species were also strongly supported in ML and BI analyses. All recognised species can be reliably identified by all four examined genetic loci. Phenotype analysis was performed to support the delimitation of new species and includes colony characteristics on seven cultivation media incubated at several temperatures, growth on an osmotic gradient (six media with NaCl concentration from 0 to 25 {\%}) and analysis of morphology including scanning electron microscopy. The micromorphology of conidial heads, vesicle dimensions, temperature profiles and growth parameters in osmotic gradient were useful criteria for species identification. The vast majority of species in sect. Restricti produce asperglaucide, asperphenamate or both in contrast to species in sect. Aspergillus. Mycophenolic acid was detected for the first time in at least six members of the section. The ascomata of A. halophilicus do not contain auroglaucin, epiheveadride or flavoglaucin which are common in sect. Aspergillus, but shares the echinulins with sect. Aspergillus.},

Historic{\&}mdash;and also new built{\&}mdash;pipe organs combine all those materials. In this study, halotolerant aspergilli and penicillia with low optimal temperatures were shown to be the most frequent invaders of pipe organs. The fungi form white mycelia on the organic components of the organs with a clear preference for the bolus paint of the wooden pipes, the leather-made hinges of the stop actions and all parts fixed by organic glue. Physiological tests showed that the strains isolated from the instruments all show a halotolerant behavior, although none was halophilic. The optimum growth temperature is below 20 {\&}deg;C, thus the fungi are perfectly adapted to the cool and relatively dry conditions in the churches and organs respectively. The de-novo genome sequences analyses of the strains are currently ongoing and will reveal the genomic basis for the halotolerant behavior of the fungi.},

abstract = {The phylogenetic diversity of microorganisms living at high salt concentrations is surprising. Halophiles are found in each of the three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya. The metabolic diversity of halophiles is great as well: they include oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs, aerobic heterotrophs, fermenters, denitrifiers, sulfate reducers, and methanogens. The diversity of metabolic types encountered decreases with salinity. The upper salinity limit at which each dissimilatory process takes place is correlated with the amount of energy generated and the energetic cost of osmotic adaptation. Our understanding of the biodiversity in salt-saturated environments has increased greatly in recent years. Using a combination of culture techniques, molecular biological methods, and chemotaxonomic studies, we have obtained information on the nature of the halophilic Archaea as well as the halophilic Bacteria that inhabit saltern crystallizer ponds. Several halophilic microorganisms are being exploited in biotechnology. In some cases, such as the production of ectoine, the product is directly related to the halophilic behavior of the producing microorganism. In other cases, such as the extraction of beta-carotene from Dunaliella or the potential use of Haloferax species for the production of poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoate or extracellular polysaccharides, similar products can be obtained from non-halophiles, but halophilic microorganisms may present advantages over the use of non-halophilic counterparts.},

A range of water activities (aw) (0.98, 0.95, 0.90 and 0.84) and temperatures (15 degrees, 25 degrees and 30 degrees C) were studied on agar media in Petri dishes, and with dried fish as a substrate at 0.90 and 0.84 aw at 30 degrees C. Generally, the fungi exhibited one of two interaction types: mutual inhibition on contact, or inhibition of one or both species on contact, with the inhibited species continuing to grow at a significantly reduced rate. On glucose-based agar media A. wentii and E. rubrum were most competitive at all aw values and temperatures studied, while on NaCl media P. pisce and B. halophila were usually most competitive. The Petri dish system was a useful model, but did not completely simulate the interactions observed on dried fish. Polypaecilum pisce and B. halophila were able to compete more strongly on fish than on agar media, especially at 0.90 aw. This study provides some evidence that each species examined had a niche in which it was dominant, and that species interactions as well as environmental factors are important in determining the dominant fungal species on dried salted fish.},

abstract = {The amino acid compositions of proteins from halophilic archaea were compared with those from non-halophilic mesophiles and thermophiles, in terms of the protein surface and interior, on a genome-wide scale. As we previously reported for proteins from thermophiles, a biased amino acid composition also exists in halophiles, in which an abundance of acidic residues was found on the protein surface as compared to the interior. This general feature did not seem to depend on the individual protein structures, but was applicable to all proteins encoded within the entire genome. Unique protein surface compositions are common in both halophiles and thermophiles. Statistical tests have shown that significant surface compositional differences exist among halophiles, non-halophiles, and thermophiles, while the interior composition within each of the three types of organisms does not significantly differ. Although thermophilic proteins have an almost equal abundance of both acidic and basic residues, a large excess of acidic residues in halophilic proteins seems to be compensated by fewer basic residues. Aspartic acid, lysine, asparagine, alanine, and threonine significantly contributed to the compositional differences of halophiles from meso- and thermophiles. Among them, however, only aspartic acid deviated largely from the expected amount estimated from the dinucleotide composition of the genomic DNA sequence of the halophile, which has an extremely high G+C content (68{\%}). Thus, the other residues with large deviations (Lys, Ala, etc.) from their non-halophilic frequencies could have arisen merely as "dragging effects" caused by the compositional shift of the DNA, which would have changed to increase principally the fraction of aspartic acid alone.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Halophilic prokaryotes are adapted to thrive in extreme conditions of salinity. Identification and analysis of distinct macromolecular characteristics of halophiles provide insight into the factors responsible for their adaptation to high-salt environments. The current report presents an extensive and systematic comparative analysis of genome and proteome composition of halophilic and non-halophilic microorganisms, with a view to identify such macromolecular signatures of haloadaptation. RESULTS Comparative analysis of the genomes and proteomes of halophiles and non-halophiles reveals some common trends in halophiles that transcend the boundary of phylogenetic relationship and the genomic GC-content of the species. At the protein level, halophilic species are characterized by low hydrophobicity, over-representation of acidic residues, especially Asp, under-representation of Cys, lower propensities for helix formation and higher propensities for coil structure. At the DNA level, the dinucleotide abundance profiles of halophilic genomes bear some common characteristics, which are quite distinct from those of non-halophiles, and hence may be regarded as specific genomic signatures for salt-adaptation. The synonymous codon usage in halophiles also exhibits similar patterns regardless of their long-term evolutionary history. CONCLUSION The generality of molecular signatures for environmental adaptation of extreme salt-loving organisms, demonstrated in the present study, advocates the convergent evolution of halophilic species towards specific genome and amino acid composition, irrespective of their varying GC-bias and widely disparate taxonomic positions. The adapted features of halophiles seem to be related to physical principles governing DNA and protein stability, in response to the extreme environmental conditions under which they thrive.},

In addition to defense responses, SA plays an important role in the response to abiotic stresses, including drought, low temperature, and salinity stresses. It has been suggested that SA has great agronomic potential to improve the stress tolerance of agriculturally important crops. However, the utility of SA is dependent on the concentration of the applied SA, the mode of application, and the state of the plants (e.g., developmental stage and acclimation). Generally, low concentrations of applied SA alleviate the sensitivity to abiotic stresses, and high concentrations of applied induce high levels of oxidative stress, leading to a decreased tolerance to abiotic stresses.

abstract = {The trace element zinc is required for proper functioning of a large number of proteins, including various enzymes. However, most zinc-containing proteins are transcription factors capable of binding DNA and are named zinc finger proteins. They form one of the largest families of transcriptional regulators and are categorized into various classes according to zinc-binding motifs. This review focuses on one class of zinc finger proteins called zinc cluster (or binuclear) proteins. Members of this family are exclusively fungal and possess the well-conserved motif CysX(2)CysX(6)CysX(5-12)CysX(2)CysX(6-8)Cys. The cysteine residues bind to two zinc atoms, which coordinate folding of the domain involved in DNA recognition. The first- and best-studied zinc cluster protein is Gal4p, a transcriptional activator of genes involved in the catabolism of galactose in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Since the discovery of Gal4p, many other zinc cluster proteins have been characterized; they function in a wide range of processes, including primary and secondary metabolism and meiosis. Other roles include regulation of genes involved in the stress response as well as pleiotropic drug resistance, as demonstrated in budding yeast and in human fungal pathogens. With the number of characterized zinc cluster proteins growing rapidly, it is becoming more and more apparent that they are important regulators of fungal physiology.},

In this study, we establish homology between previously recognized APC superfamily members and proteins of seven new families. These families include the PAAP (Putative Amino Acid Permease), LIVCS (Branched Chain Amino Acid:Cation Symporter), NRAMP (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein), CstA (Carbon starvation A protein), KUP (K⁺ Uptake Permease), BenE (Benzoate:H⁺ Virginia Symporter), and AE (Anion Exchanger). The topology of the well-characterized human Anion Exchanger 1 (AE1) conforms to a UraA-like topology of 14 TMSs (12 $\alpha$-helical TMSs and 2 mixed coil/helical TMSs). All functionally characterized members of the APC superfamily use cation symport for substrate accumulation except for some members of the AE family which frequently use anion:anion exchange. We show how the different topologies fit into the framework of the common LeuT-like fold, defined earlier (Proteins. 2014 Feb;82(2):336-46), and determine that some of the new members contain previously undocumented topological variations. All new entries contain the two 5 or 7 TMS APC superfamily repeat units, sometimes with extra TMSs at the ends, the variations being greatest within the CstA family. New, functionally characterized members transport amino acids, peptides, and inorganic anions or cations. Except for anions, these are typical substrates of established APC superfamily members. Active site TMSs are rich in glycyl residues in variable but conserved constellations. This work expands the APC superfamily and our understanding of its topological variations.},

abstract = {In this paper an analysis of 175 currently sequenced transport proteins that comprise the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) superfamily is reported. Members of this superfamily fall into 10 well-defined families that are either prokaryote specific, eukaryote specific or ubiquitous. Most of these proteins exhibit 12 probable transmembrane spanners (TMSs), but members of two of these families deviate from this pattern, exhibiting 10 and 14 TMSs. All members of these families are tabulated, their functional properties are reviewed and phylogenetic/sequence analyses define the evolutionary relationships of the proteins to each other. Evidence is presented that the APC superfamily may include two other currently recognized families that exhibit greater degrees of sequence divergence from APC superfamily members than do the proteins of the 10 established families from each other. At least some of the protein members of these two distantly related families exhibit 11 established TMSs. Altogether, the APC superfamily probably includes 12 currently recognized families with members that exhibit exclusive specificity for amino acids and their derivatives but which can possess 10, 11, 12 or 14 TMSs per polypeptide chain.},

The alanine or glycine: cation symporter (AGCS) family belongs to APC superfamily and is found in prokaryotes, but its substrate specificity remains to be clarified. In this study, we found that a halotolerant cyanobacterium, Aphanothece halophytica has two putative ApagcS genes. The deduced amino acid sequence of one of genes, ApagcS1, exhibited high homology to Pseudomonas AgcS. The ApagcS1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli JW4166 which is deficient in glycine uptake. Kinetics studies in JW4166 revealed that ApAgcS1 is a sodium-dependent glycine transporter. Competition experiments showed the significant inhibition by glutamine, asparagine, and glycine. The level of mRNA for ApagcS1 was induced by NaCl and nitrogen-deficient stresses. Uptake of glutamine by ApAgcS1 was also observed. Based on these data, the phys...},

The pathogens showed enzymic adaptation to the polymers present in the integuments of their particular hosts. Thus, the plant pathogens produced high levels of enzymes capable of degrading pectic polysaccharides, cellulose and xylan, as well as a cutinase substrate, but secreted little or no chitinase and showed no proteolytic activity against elastin and mucin. The entomopathogens and V. fungicola degraded a broad spectrum of proteins (including elastin and mucin) but, except for chitinase, cellulase (V. lecanii and V. fungicola only) and cutinase (B. bassiana only), produced very low levels of polysaccharidases. The saprophytes (Neu. crassa and A. nidulans) and the opportunistic pathogens (A. fumigatus and A. flavus) produced the broadest spectrum of protein and polysaccharide degrading enzymes, indicative of their less specialized nutritional status. V. lecanii and V. albo-atrum were compared in more detail to identify factors that distinguish plant and insect pathogens. V. albo-atrum, but not V. lecanii, grew well on different plant cell wall components. The major class of proteases produced in different media by isolates of V. albo-atrum and V. dahliae were broad spectrum basic (pl {\textgreater} 10) trypsins which degrade Z-AA-AA-Arg-NA substrates (Z, benzoyl; AA, various amino acids; NA, nitroanilide), hide protein azure and insect (Manduca sexta) cuticles. Analogous peptidases were produced by isolates of V. lecanii and V. fungicola but they were specific for Z-Phe-Val-Arg-NA. V. albo-atrum and V. dahliae also produced low levels of neutral (pl ca 7) and basic (pl ca 9.5) subtilisin-like proteases active against a chymotrypsin substrate (Succinyl-Ala2-Pro-Phe-NA) and insect cuticle. In contrast, subtilisins comprised the major protease component secreted by V. lecanii and V. fungicola. Both V. lecanii and V. albo-atrum produced the highest levels of subtilisin and trypsin-like activities during growth on collagen or insect cuticle.

abstract = {Fungi are able to switch between different lifestyles in order to adapt to environmental changes. Their ecological strategy is connected to their secretome as fungi obtain nutrients by secreting hydrolytic enzymes to their surrounding and acquiring the digested molecules. We focus on fungal serine proteases (SPs), the phylogenetic distribution of which is barely described so far. In order to collect a complete set of fungal proteases, we searched over 600 fungal proteomes. Obtained results suggest that serine proteases are more ubiquitous than expected. From 54 SP families described in MEROPS Peptidase Database, 21 are present in fungi. Interestingly, 14 of them are also present in Metazoa and Viridiplantae – this suggests that, except one (S64), all fungal SP families evolved before plants and fungi diverged. Most representatives of sequenced eukaryotic lineages encode a set of 13–16 SP families. The number of SPs from each family varies among the analysed taxa. The most abundant are S8 proteases. In order to verify hypotheses linking lifestyle and expansions of particular SP, we performed statistical analyses and revealed previously undescribed associations. Here, we present a comprehensive evolutionary history of fungal SP families in the context of fungal ecology and fungal tree of life.},

abstract = {We describe a signaling pathway that mediates salt stress responses in Arabidopsis. The response is mechanistically related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses described in mammalian systems. Such responses involve processing and relocation to the nucleus of ER membrane-associated transcription factors to activate stress response genes. The salt stress response in Arabidopsis requires a subtilisin-like serine protease (AtS1P), related to mammalian S1P and a membrane-localized b-ZIP transcription factor, AtbZIP17, a predicted type-II membrane protein with a canonical S1P cleavage site on its lumen-facing side and a b-ZIP domain on its cytoplasmic side. In response to salt stress, it was found that myc-tagged AtbZIP17 was cleaved in an AtS1P-dependent process. To show that AtS1P directly targets AtbZIP17, cleavage was also demonstrated in an in vitro pull-down assay with agarose bead-immobilized AtS1P. Under salt stress conditions, the N-terminal fragment of AtbZIP17 tagged with GFP was translocated to the nucleus. The N-terminal fragment bearing the bZIP DNA binding domain was also found to possess transcriptional activity that functions in yeast. In Arabidopsis, AtbZIP17 activation directly or indirectly upregulated the expression of several salt stress response genes, including the homeodomain transcription factor ATHB-7. Upregulation of these genes by salt stress was blocked by T-DNA insertion mutations in AtS1P and AtbZIP17. Thus, salt stress induces a signaling cascade involving the processing of AtbZIP17, its translocation to the nucleus and the upregulation of salt stress genes.},

abstract = {Hypersaline environments with salt concentrations up to NaCl saturation are inhabited by a great diversity of microorganisms belonging to the three domains of life. They all must cope with the low water activity of their environment, but different strategies exist to provide osmotic balance of the cells' cytoplasm with the salinity of the medium. One option used by many halophilic Archaea and a few representatives of the Bacteria is to accumulate salts, mainly KCl and to adapt the entire intracellular machinery to function in the presence of molar concentrations of salts. A more widespread option is the synthesis or accumulation of organic osmotic, so-called compatible solutes. Here, we review the mechanisms of osmotic adaptation in a number of model organisms, including the KCl accumulating Halobacterium salinarum (Archaea) and Salinibacter ruber (Bacteria), Halomonas elongata as a representative of the Bacteria that synthesize organic osmotic solutes, eukaryotic microorganisms including the unicellular green alga Dunaliella salina and the black yeasts Hortaea werneckii and the basidiomycetous Wallemia ichthyophaga, which use glycerol and other compatible solutes. The strategies used by these model organisms and by additional halophilic microorganisms presented are then compared to obtain an integrative picture of the adaptations to life at high salt concentrations in the microbial world.},

abstract = {Osmotolerance and halotolerance are used to describe resistance to sugars and salt, respectively. Here, a comprehensive screen of more than 600 different yeast isolates revealed that osmosensitive species were equally affected by NaCl and glucose. However, the relative toxicity of salt became increasingly prominent in more osmoresistant species. We confirmed that growth inhibition by glucose in a laboratory strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurred at a lower water activity (Aw) than by salt (NaCl), and pre-growth in high levels of glucose or salt gave enhanced cross-resistance to either. Salt toxicity was largely due to osmotic stress but with an additive enhancement due to effects of the relevant cation. Almost all of the yeast isolates from the screen were also noted to exhibit hetero-resistance to both salt and sugar, whereby high concentrations restricted growth to a small minority of cells within the clonal populations. Rare resistant colonies required growth for up to 28 days to become visible. This cell individuality was more marked with salt than sugar, a possible further reflection of the ion toxicity effect. In both cases, heteroresistance in S. cerevisiae was strikingly dependent on the GPD1 gene product, important for glycerol synthesis. In contrast, a tps1$\Delta$ deletant impaired for trehalose showed altered MIC but no change in heteroresistance. Effects on heteroresistance were evident in chronic (but not acute) salt or glucose stress, particularly relevant to growth on low Aw foods. The study reports diverse osmotolerance and halotolerance phenotypes and heteroresistance across an extensive panel of yeast isolates, and indicates that Gpd1-dependent glycerol synthesis is a key determinant enabling growth of rare yeast subpopulations at low Aw, brought about by glucose and in particular salt.},

The osmoregulatory system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is particularly well understood, although many details of the regulatory mechanisms still remain to be discovered. Central to yeast osmoregulation is the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signalling network, a branched mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that converges on the MAPK Hog1. Active Hog1 controls numerous cellular processes in the cytosol (cell cycle, translation, ion, water and glycerol transport and central metabolism) as well as the expression of numerous genes. In order to achieve a quantitative understanding and to fit different processes in a temporal order, we have generated a comprehensive mathematical model of yeast osmoregulation in collaboration with theoreticians. Using model simulation and quantitative time-course experimentation, we have analysed mechanisms of feedback control of the HOG pathway. These studies illustrate how a signalling pathway combines rigorous feedback control with maintenance of signalling competence, as required for a system controlling cell homeostasis.},

abstract = {The ability to adapt to altered availability of free water is a fundamental property of living cells. The principles underlying osmoadaptation are well conserved. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model system with which to study the molecular biology and physiology of osmoadaptation. Upon a shift to high osmolarity, yeast cells rapidly stimulate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which orchestrates part of the transcriptional response. The dynamic operation of the HOG pathway has been well studied, and similar osmosensing pathways exist in other eukaryotes. Protein kinase A, which seems to mediate a response to diverse stress conditions, is also involved in the transcriptional response program. Expression changes after a shift to high osmolarity aim at adjusting metabolism and the production of cellular protectants. Accumulation of the osmolyte glycerol, which is also controlled by altering transmembrane glycerol transport, is of central importance. Upon a shift from high to low osmolarity, yeast cells stimulate a different MAP kinase cascade, the cell integrity pathway. The transcriptional program upon hypo-osmotic shock seems to aim at adjusting cell surface properties. Rapid export of glycerol is an important event in adaptation to low osmolarity. Osmoadaptation, adjustment of cell surface properties, and the control of cell morphogenesis, growth, and proliferation are highly coordinated processes. The Skn7p response regulator may be involved in coordinating these events. An integrated understanding of osmoadaptation requires not only knowledge of the function of many uncharacterized genes but also further insight into the time line of events, their interdependence, their dynamics, and their spatial organization as well as the importance of subtle effects.},
